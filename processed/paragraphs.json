We have studied the role\nof the Mll–AF9 gene fusion made in mouse embryonic\nstem cells by an homologous recombination knock-\nin. Acute leukaemias developed in heterozygous mice\ncarrying this fusion as well as in chimeric mice. As\nwith human chromosomal translocation t(9;11), the\nmajority of cases were acute myeloid leukaemias\ninvolving immature myeloblasts, but a\n(AMLs)\nminority were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The\nAMLs were preceded by effects on haematopoietic\ndifferentiation involving a myeloproliferation resulting\nin accumulation of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive mature\nmyeloid cells in bone marrow as early as 6 days after\nbirth. Therefore, non-malignant expansion of myeloid\nprecursors is the ﬁrst stage of Mll–AF9-mediated leuk-\naemia followed by accumulation of malignant cells in\nbone marrow and other tissues. Thus, the late onset of\novert tumours suggests that secondary tumorigenic\nmutations are necessary for malignancy associated with\nMLL–AF9 gene fusion and that myeloproliferation\nprovides the pool of cells in which such events can occur.\nKeywords: ALL-1/chromosomal translocations/\nhaematopoiesis/HRX/leukaemia",

There is a strong correlation between the leukaemia\nphenotype and each of these speciﬁc MLL translocation\nfusions (Corral et al., 1993; Thirman et al., 1993). The\ntranslocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) is mainly associated with\nAMLs (Iida et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993) while\nthe translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) is found predominantly\nin ALLs (Gu et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993; Iida et al.,\n1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993;\nDowning et al., 1994).

These\nﬁndings suggest that the incoming fusion partner of MLL\nhelps to specify the cell type of the tumour. Thus, the\nfusion protein itself may inﬂuence tumour type if the\nchromosomal translocation occurs in a pluripotent pre-\ncursor cell. It is nonetheless possible that the chromosomal\ntranslocation may occur in a committed precursor because\nthe chromosomal region is accessible for the chromosomal\ntranslocation event, in which case the protein fusion would\nnot strictly specify tumour type. Several biological models\nhave been established to gain insights into the role of the\nMLL fusions in tumorigenesis. The use of retroviruses\nencoding the MLL/HRX–ENL fusion to infect primitive\ncells showed that myeloid cell proliferation could be\nobserved and that tumours of this lineage emerged (Lavau\net al., 1997; Slany et al., 1997). These experiments suggest\nthat a gain-of-function mechanism at least partly explains\nthe role of this fusion protein which is made after the\nchromosomal translocation t(11;19) in humans.

The propensity of the MLL gene to form\nfusion genes after chromosomal translocations is important\nbecause (cid:46)15% of all acute leukaemias in man have MLL\ngene fusions and because there is an association of\nparticular MLL fusions with particular subtypes of acute\nleukaemia. For instance, MLL–AF4/FEL fusions are typic-\nally found in lymphoblastic tumours, whereas MLL–AF9\nfusions are typically found in myeloid tumours (Djabali\net al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993; Iida\net al., 1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura et al.,\n1993). This implies a speciﬁc role for the chimeric protein\nin determination of the type of leukaemia which develops.\nNonetheless, an alternative possibility is based purely on\nmechanism and accessibility of genes in chromosomes.\nThus the ability of MLL and AF9 or MLL and AF4\ngenomic regions to take part in an inter-chromosomal\ntranslocation may be greater in committed myeloid or\nlymphoid cells, respectively. The alternative models can\nbe assessed using animal models of disease in which gene\nfusion is either controlled by speciﬁc interchromosomal\nevents (Smith et al., 1995; van Deursen et al., 1995) or\nby knock-in of the fusion gene partner (Thomas and\nCapecchi, 1987; Corral et al., 1996). We have developed\nand analysed a model for MLL–AF9-induced leukaemia\nusing homologous recombination to knock-in the AF9 into\nthe endogenous mouse Mll gene (Corral et al., 1996).

They\npredominate infant acute leukaemia (80% of ALL and 65% of\nAML), and account for the majority of therapy-related (secondary)\nleukaemias developing in 5 – 15% of primary cancer patients who\nhad received intensive chemotherapy, including epipodophyllo-\ntoxins (VP16) and anthracyclines (doxorubicin) (Pui and Relling,\n2000). These drugs are inhibitors of topoisomerase II, and act by\nstabilising double-strand DNA breaks generated by this enzyme. In\nthe latency period is\nboth infant and secondary leukaemias,\nremarkably brief. In infants, ALL-1 rearrangements can be already\ndetected in utero and the average age at diagnosis is 6 months, and\nin secondary leukaemias, latency averages around 18 – 30 months\n(reviewed in Greaves, 1999; Pui and Relling, 2000). The very brief\nin\ntime between the initiating event and clinical disease,\nconjunction with the high rate of concordance in identical twins\nwith infant leukaemia, points to the effectiveness of ALL-1 fusion\nproteins in driving the initial clone into frank leukaemia.

    "paragraph": "Two methodologies have been used to generate mouse models of\nALL-1 leukaemogenesis. Knockin of the partner gene AF9 into the\nALL-1 locus by homologous recombination resulted in animals\nthat developed AML at approximately 6 months (Dobson et al,\n1999). Transmission of the transgene in the germ line and its\nexpression during embryogenesis resulted in viable progeny. This,\ntogether with the observation that mice carrying a single null allele\nof ALL-1 were not predisposed to AML (Corral et al, 1996), rules\nout a model of leukaemogenesis due to haploinsufficiency (passive\nloss of function). Rather, an extensive series of investigations\napplying retro viral transduction into cultured haematopoietic\nfollowed by transplantation into mice, have\nprogenitor cells,\nestablished that ALL-1 fusion genes act as dominant alleles and the\ndisease is due to ALL-1 gain of function. Structure – function\nanalysis of several ALL-1 fusion proteins showed that particular\nelements within the partner proteins, such as transcription effector\ndomains and protein – protein interaction motifs, are critical for\nthe leukaemogenic activity (reviewed in Ayton and Cleary, 2001).\nThe presence of dimerisation domains in some of the partner\nproteins, such as AF6, AF10, AF17, AF1p, GAS7 and AF3p21\nsuggested that self-association might underlie the role of the\npartner proteins with such motifs in the leukaemogenicity of ALL-\n1 fusion proteins. The most compelling experimental evidence for\nthis is that homodimerisation of ALL-1 by synthetic dimerisation\nmodules mimics many of the features of ALL-1 fusion proteins\n(Dobson et al, 2000; So et al, 2003b, Martin et al, 2003). Also,\ndisruption of the dimerisation motifs in some partner proteins\neliminated pathogenicity. Although self-dimerisation appears to\nplay a key role in leukaemogenesis associated with partner\nproteins containing a dimerisation motif,\nthe most common\nfusions – ALL-1/AF4, ALL-1/AF9 and ALL-1/ENL – do not dimerise.\nBoth the knockin and retroviral transduction approaches turned\nout to be biased towards myeloid leukaemia. However, very recent\nstudies with virally transduced ALL1-ENL (Zeisig et al, 2003) and\nALL1-GAS7 (So et al, 2003a) showed transformation of bipheno-\ntypic lymphoid/myeloid cells and induction of biphenotypic\nleukaemia. So et al serially plated the transduced bone marrows\nin methylcellulose and found that the fusion protein conferred\nlong-term growth capacity to multipotential progenitors. The\nprogenitors spontaneously differentiated into biphenotypic and\nmyeloid progenitors during culturing in vitro. Moreover, mice\ninjected with the transduced serially-plated progenitors developed\neither biphenotypic leukaemia, or AML or ALL. On the basis of\nthese experiments, it was proposed that ALL-1 fusion proteins\nenhance the self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors that\nretain an ability to differentiate into downstream progeny. The\nlatter are more susceptible to differentiation blocking by ALL-1\nfusion proteins, or are prone to secondary mutations required for\nfull malignant transformation.",

The TrxG and PcG proteins are not\nrequired for initiation of HOX genes activity, but act to maintain\ntranscriptional states through later stages of development (re-\nviewed in Brock and van Lohuizen, 2001; Simon and Tamkun,\n2002).

Approximately 20 genes have\nbeen characterised as members of the fly TrxG; however, this\nnumber is rapidly growing based on genetic and molecular criteria\n(Gildea et al, 2000; Faucheux et al, 2003).

The emerging picture of the best studied\ntarget, the regulatory region of the Drosophila Bithorax complex\nBX-C gene Ubx, suggests that although TREs and PREs are\nintermingled within a 1.5 kb region bxd, they may represent\nseparable regulatory elements (Tillib et al, 1999).

Evidence that these proteins may\noccupy their binding sites depending on the status of gene\nexpression came recently from analysis of Drosophila larval fat\nbody (Marchetti et al, 2003). BX-C genes are repressed in the\nanterior region of the fat body, but are active in the mid-posterior\npart. In parallel, the PC protein (but not TRX) was detected at the\ncytological site of bithorax on polytene chromosomes from\nthe anterior part of\nthe fat body, while a strong signal of\nTRX (but not of PC) was detected on chromosomes from the\nmid-posterior fat body.",

Identification of such genes is clearly a focal\npoint for understanding the disease in molecular terms and for\nfuture therapeutic intervention. However, other central questions\nremain. First, do all ALL-1 fusions, including self-fusions, trigger a\nsingle pathway leading to disease? Why are most fusions associated\nwith specific leukaemia subtype (e.g. ALL1-AF4 with ALL, ALL1-\nAF6 with AML)? Second, since the fusion proteins lack the SET\ndomain with its histone H3-Lys4 methylation activity, how do they\nretain transcriptional activation capacity? Do they target all genes\nregulated by normal ALL-1? Do they compete with normal ALL-1\non the same targets? Do they block transcription of some loci?\nAlso, the absence of the PHD fingers in ALL-1 fusion proteins\nshould relieve them from potential regulation by phosphoinosi-\ntides; whether this is an important aspect of the leukaemogenic\nactivity of these proteins has yet to be determined. A third issue is\nwhether ALL-1 fusions confer resistance to apoptosis. ALL-1-\nassociated leukaemias are notorious for their poor prognosis with\nchemotherapy, and exhibit drug resistance.

The\ns.c. route of inoculation was chosen be-\ncause it induced smaller tumours which\nregressed more rapidly, so that survival\nwas greater, though the immunity in-\nduced was as strong as with the i.m. route.\nMoreover, the long-term pathogenicity\nresponsible for recurrences of sarcoma in\nsites different from the first inoculation\n(diaphragm, spleen, liver) was also sig-\nnificantly reduced. The explanation may\nbe that in the s.c. region there is less\nmuscular tissue available for the replica-\ntion of the virus with special tropism for\nthis tissue. The effectiveness of the experi-\nmental protocol using MSV-M as a live\nvaccine\nfor immunoprevention studies\nwas confirmed in the first group of experi-\nments in which immunized mice were\nchallenged with FLV, RLV7 and MLV, also\nused in other laboratories for immuno-\nprevention assays. Extension of the ex-\nperiments to\nother leukaemia\nviruses\noriginating\nour laboratory showed\nin\neffective protection against primary leuk-\naemias induced by PLLV and HI 79A/LV.\nHowever, although serological data (Fefer,\n1967) and in immunization with MSV-G\n(Basombrio et al., 1977) have indicated the\npresence of cross-reacting antigens in GLV'\nand MSV-M, no significant\nprotection\nagainst GLV could be detected.",

On the other\nhand, 6-month-old mice show again a\ngreat sensitivity to MSV-M oncogenesis\n(Pazmifio & Yuhas, 1973). Thus renewed\nMSV-M sarcomagenesis might cause un-\nexpected mortality in long-term experi-\nments due to reactivation of the virus.\nThirdly, the genotype of mice has a great\nbearing on the result of MSV-M onco-\ngenesis: BALB/c mice are known to be\nvery susceptible, whilst (Swiss x AKR) F1\nhybrids are very resistant (Colombatti et\nal., 1975) which could account for the\nobserved difference in mortality.",

MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities\nin infant and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)\nand do not normally acquire secondary mutations compared to other leukaemias. To model these\nleukaemias, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9\ngene editing to induce MLL-AF9 (MA9) chromosomal rearrangements in murine hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cell lines and primary cells. By utilizing a dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA)\napproach targeting the breakpoint cluster region of murine Mll and Af9 equivalent to that in human\nMA9 rearrangements, we show eﬃcient de novo generation of MA9 fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels in the bulk population. The leukaemic features of MA9-induced disease were\nobserved including increased clonogenicity, enrichment of c-Kit-positive leukaemic stem cells and\nincreased MA9 target gene expression. This approach provided a rapid and reliable means of de\nnovo generation of Mll-Af9 genetic rearrangements in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor\ncells (HSPCs), using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce a cellular model of MA9 leukaemias which\nfaithfully reproduces many features of the human disease in vitro.",

These leukaemias do not typically acquire many secondary mutations [2] and are\nthought to result from inappropriate repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) via nonhomologous\nend joining (NHEJ) in haematopoietic cells [3]. As the 8.3-kb breakpoint cluster region of mixed\nlineage leukaemia (MLL) is located between exons 8 and 13 for almost all MLLr cases [4], these fusion\ngenes contain the ﬁrst 8–13 exons of MLL and a variable number of exons from the fusion partner\ngenes (FPGs).

These properties appear to play a critical role in\nleukaemic transformation [11,12]. Oncogenic properties of MLL fusion proteins include interference\nwith transcriptional elongation, resulting in dysregulation of target genes [13,14]. Aberrant expression\nof MLL target genes is strongly dependent on DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation [15], which is\na critical requirement for MA9 leukaemogensis [16]. Members of the Homeobox (HOX) family are\ncommonly overexpressed in MLLr leukaemias as a direct target of MLL fusion proteins [4,17]. The HOX\nfamily are critical factors in the self-renewing properties of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their\noverexpression results in a diﬀerentiation block and an increase in self-renewal of immature myeloid\nprogenitor cells. The HOX cofactors MEIS1 [18,19] and PBX3 [20] are also direct targets of MLL fusion\nproteins [21] frequently found upregulated in coordination with HOX targets. Importantly, there is\nevidence to suggest that MA9-mediated leukaemia can progress even in the absence of HOX genes\nsuch as HOXA9 [22], indicating an important role of non-HOX family genes. This includes CDK6 [23],\nEVI-1 [24,25] and EYA1 [26,27], which are also found upregulated in MLLr leukaemias as a result of\ndirect binding of MLL-FPG proteins to gene promoters [26,28,29], and play a vital role in leukaemic\ntransformation including cellular immortalization [26], hyperproliferation [23,24], chemoresistance [24]\nand dysregulated self-renewal [25,27]. CDK6 speciﬁcally has been highlighted as a critical eﬀector of\nMLLr leukemogenesis as its depletion in mice with MA9-driven AML was shown to overcome the\nmyeloid diﬀerentiation block and to prolong survival in vivo [29].",

Retrovirus-mediated expression models however drive transgene expressions that\nare not physiological. To gain greater control over the level of cell-restricted transgene expression,\nDox-inducible transgenic models have since been developed [39,40] enabling close-to-physiological\nlevels and reversible transgene expression in a Dox dose-dependent manner. Using this model, it was\ndemonstrated that long-term HSC (LT-HSC) populations result in an invasive and chemoresistant AML\nwith a primitive progenitor phenotype and a distinct stemness-related gene expression pattern [39].\nDox-inducible transgene expression is however not controlled by an endogenous promoter. “Leaky” Cre\nexpression from tissue-speciﬁc promoters together with the expensive and time-consuming nature of\ntissue-restricted strain generation are major limitations with the Cre-loxP and Dox-inducible transgenic\nmodel systems. More recent attempts to circumvent some of the issues highlighted above have utilized\ntranscription activator like eﬀector nucleases (TALEN) technology to generate endogenous MA9 [41,42].\nThese cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher clonogenic potential with colony morphologies consistent\nwith an immature cell type and development of AML, ALL and MPAL upon xenotransplantation [41].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology facilitates\ncreation of DSBs at almost any genomic sequence of interest technology and has revolutionised the\nway in which we are able to manipulate the genome, aﬀording a more ﬂexible and readily applicable\nmethod for generating novel disease models, including chromosomal translocations, with an ease and\nsimplicity far outweighing prior technologies such as TALEN and Cre-LoxP.

We recently found that passive therapy with\nantileukaemia sera can give positive results only when the highest possible number of\ncytolytic potency units is administered (Reif and Kim, 1969). To prepare highly potent\nantisera, both immunization schedules and the dependence of the specificity of antisera\non the types of leukaemias injected (Mohos and Kidd, 1957) require investigation. In a\nseparate investigation (Kim and Reif, 1971), we have studied immunization schedules.\nIn the present paper, the requirements for specificity of antisera, in terms of the strain of\n1087",

Namely, a subset of AMLs has long been \nrecognized to harbour clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulin (Ig) gene \nrearrangements, indicating activity of the RAG recombinase that is responsible for \ngenerating somatic V(D)J recombination at these loci at specific stages of lymphoid \ndevelopment (Norton et al, 1987; Parreira et al, 1992; Schmidt et al, 1992). These AML \ncases can also express the lymphoid marker terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT, also \nknown as DNTT), which generates diversity at the TCR and Ig genes by mutating the \njunctions of rearrangements during V(D)J recombination (Drexler et al, 1993; Patel et al, \n2013). Non-megakaryoblastic AMLs with TCR rearrangements typically co-express \nphenotypic markers of T-lymphoblastic differentiation, such as CD7, CD2 and CD4 \n(Schmidt et al, 1992). We postulate that this is the subset of AMLs that also harbour \nmutations that are commonly observed in a distinct subset of T-ALL, including WT1, PHF6, \nRUNX1 and BCL11B (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; Della Gatta et \nal, 2012; Ding et al, 2012; Klco et al, 2015; Tosello et al, 2009; Van Vlierberghe et al, 2010; \nVan Vlierberghe et al, 2011b; Zhang et al, 2012). Thus, a similar group of acute leukaemias \nexhibit shared features of myeloid and T cell lymphoid differentiation, and shared genetic \nmutations, which will need to be formally assessed in future studies.",

Nevertheless, even if a normal progenitor whose differentiation \nfate is restricted to T-lymphocytes and myeloid cells is lacking, such leukaemias \ncan arise from cells that retain multi-lineage potential, even though their fate is \nnormally restricted to a single lineage by microenvironmental signals.

However, we note that aberrant expression of CD4 and CD7 is relatively \ncommon in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL), a subtype of AML that is \nmolecularly distinct from AMTL (de Rooij et al, 2017). Therefore, AMKL should be \nexcluded from the definition of AMTL, based on absence of megakaryblastic morphology \nand expression of the platelet markers CD41 or CD61.

A total of twenty patients with acute leukaemias having undergone HSCT were selected and assessed for \nthe analysis of chimerism status.

These  patients \nhad undergone HSCT from Pakistan Institute of Medical Science and Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre. \nResults: The peaks in the PAGE densitometry represented the donor chimerism in all post transplant samples of the \npatients. \nConclusion: Our study showed that densitometry of STR PCR PAGE is a useful and cheaper method for demonstration \nof donor chimerism in acute leukaemia patients having undergone HSCT.
