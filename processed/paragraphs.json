We have studied the roleof theMll–AF9gene fusion made in mouse embryonic\nstem cells by an homologous recombination knock-in. Acute leukaemias developed in heterozygous micecarrying this fusion as well as in chimeric mice. Aswith human chromosomal translocation t(9;11), themajority of cases were acute myeloid leukaemias(AMLs) involving immature myeloblasts, but aminority were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. TheAMLs were preceded by effects on haematopoieticdifferentiation involving a myeloproliferation resultingin accumulation of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive maturemyeloid cells in bone marrow as early as 6 days afterbirth. Therefore, non-malignant expansion of myeloidprecursors is the ﬁrst stage of Mll–AF9-mediated leuk-aemia followed by accumulation of malignant cells inbone marrow and other tissues.

The cloning ofthe genes involved in the chromosomal translocationbreakpoints in leukaemias and solid tumours of mesen-chymal origin, have shown that a major molecular con-sequence of these aberrant chromosomes is creation offusion genes, and therefore of fusion proteins, when thebreaksoccurbetweenexonsofgenesoneachchromosome.\n3564\n© European Molecular Biology OrganizationThis was ﬁrst recognized for the fusion of BCRand\nABLgenes resulting from the Philadelphia chromosome\n(Nowell and Hungerford, 1960; Rowley, 1973; de Kleinet al., 1982; Bartram et al., 1983; Groffen et al., 1984).\nMolecular studies of these chromosomal breakpointsdemonstrated that two forms of the BCR–ABL fusion gene\nresultfromdistinctchromosomalbreakagewithinthe BCR\ngene, linking it to the same coding part of the ABLgene\n(Bartram etal.,1983;deKlein etal.,1986).Morerecently,\ncomplex situations have been described in subsets ofleukaemias with breaks in chromosome 11, band q23within the MLL/HRX/ALL-1 gene (Ziemin-van der Poel\net al., 1991; Djabali et al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; McCabe\net al., 1992; Tkachuk et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993)\nand in sarcomas such as those with breaks within the EWS\nandFUS/TLS genes (Delattre et al., 1992; Crozat et al.,\n1993; Rabbitts et al., 1993; Aman et al., 1996;\nPanagopoulos et al., 1996). Under these circumstances,\nthe respective genes become involved with a multitude ofdifferentchromosomaltranslocationswhicharepredomin-antly associated with a particular sub-type of leukaemiaor sarcoma. Furthermore, the FUSgene has a role in\ntranslocations in both sarcomas and in acute myeloidleukaemia (Ichikawa et al., 1994; Panagopoulos et al.,\n1994) depending on the cell type or on the fusion partner.These observations raise issues about possible roles of thefusion genes in tumour type, particularly the role thefusion partner might play in the speciﬁcity of the tumourphenotype.\nThe chromosome 11 region q23 is involved in ~10%\nof acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) and acute lympho-blastic leukaemias (ALLs), as well as in mixed lineageleukaemias andin somelymphomas. In addition,balancedchromosome 11q23 translocations are also observed intherapy-related leukaemias, especially in patients pre-viously treated with inhibitors of topoisomerase II (Ratainet al., 1987; Pui et al., 1989; Cimino et al., 1997; Nasr\net al., 1997; Rowley et al., 1997; Sobulo et al., 1997;\nAtlaset al., 1998; Felix, 1998). The cloning of the\nchromosome 11q23 breakpoint region (Ziemin-van derPoelet al., 1991) revealed the MLL/HRX/ALL-1 gene\n(Djabali et al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; McCabe et al.,\n1992; Tkachuk et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993) (herein\ndesignated the MLLgene), which encodes a 432 kDa\nprotein with several regions of structural homology toother proteins, for instance to Drosophila trithorax (Mazo\net al., 1990; Djabali et al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; Tkachuk\net al., 1992). More than 30 different chromosomal bands\nhave been found in chromosomal translocations withchromosome 11q23, and molecular studies showedrearrangements with the MLLgene in all cases (reviewed\nin Rowley, 1993; Thirman et al., 1993; Bernard and\nBerger, 1995; Rubnitz et al., 1996b; Gilliland, 1998).\nAmong the most common reciprocal translocations are\nMll–AF9 fusion causes myeloproliferation\nt(4;11)(q21;q23), t(9;11)(p22;q23) and t(11;19)(p13;q23).\nThese fuse MLLwithAF4/FEL ,AF9/LTG9 andENL/\nLTG19genes, respectively (Gu et al., 1992; Tkachuk\net al., 1992; Chen et al., 1993; Iida et al., 1993; Morrissey\net al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993; Yamamoto et al.,\n1993).Thereisastrongcorrelationbetweentheleukaemiaphenotype and each of these speciﬁc MLLtranslocation\nfusions (Corral et al., 1993; Thirman et al., 1993). The\ntranslocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) is mainly associated withAMLs (Iida et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993) while\nthe translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) is found predominantlyin ALLs (Gu et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993; Iida et al.,\n1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993;\nDowning etal.,1994).Thet(11;19)(p13;q23)translocation\non the other hand occurs in both ALL and AML butwith higher frequency in ALL (Nakamura et al., 1993;\nYamamoto et al., 1993; Rubnitz et al., 1996a). These\nﬁndings suggest that the incoming fusion partner of MLLhelps to specify the cell type of the tumour. Thus, thefusion protein itself may inﬂuence tumour type if thechromosomal translocation occurs in a pluripotent pre-cursorcell.Itisnonethelesspossiblethatthechromosomaltranslocation may occur in a committed precursor becausethechromosomalregionisaccessibleforthechromosomaltranslocationevent,inwhichcasetheproteinfusionwouldnotstrictlyspecifytumourtype.Severalbiologicalmodelshave been established to gain insights into the role of theMLLfusions in tumorigenesis. The use of retroviruses\nencoding the MLL/HRX–ENL fusion to infect primitive\ncells showed that myeloid cell proliferation could beobserved and that tumours of this lineage emerged (Lavauetal.,1997;Slany etal.,1997).Theseexperimentssuggest\nthat a gain-of-function mechanism at least partly explainsthe role of this fusion protein which is made after thechromosomaltranslocationt(11;19)inhumans.Thefusionof theAF9gene with the Mllgene also resulted in the\nemergence of AML in mice (Corral et al., 1996).\nIn the present study we show that an Mll–AF9gene\nfusion[madeinembryonicstem(ES)cellsbyhomologousrecombination] carried in the mouse germline contributesto AML. In both chimeras and heterozygous mice, themajority of mice developed AML and a small percentagedeveloped ALL. The features of this disease reﬂect thoseof the disease which develops in humans carrying theMLL–AF9translocation. Furthermore, a selective prolifer-\nation of Gr-1-positive myeloid bone marrow cells wasobserved in heterozygous animals before the symptomsofleukaemiaoccurred.Thepropensityformyeloidtumourformation therefore seems to be a consequence of theadvantageous growth of myeloid precursors caused by theMll–AF9fusion, thereby providing a pool of cells in\nwhich secondary mutations, necessary for overt tumourdevelopment, can occur.\nResults\nMll–AF9 mice develop acute leukaemia\nAnMll–AF9 fusion gene was created in mouse ES cells,\nby knock-in homologous recombination (Corral et al.,\n1996), in which an AF9cDNA was fused into exon 8 of\none allele of the endogenous Mllgene (a diagram of the\ntargeted allele is shown in Figure 1A). These ES cellswere injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and chimeric mice\n3565\nFig. 1.Germ-line transmission of the Mll–AF9 targeted allele in mice.\n(A) A diagrammatic map of the Mll–AF9 targeted allele is shown\n(Corralet al., 1996). The human AF9 cDNA sequences were fused at\nexon 8 of Mlland MC1-neo-poly(A) cassette (Thomas and Capecchi,\n1987) was cloned into the targeting vector as a positive selectionmarker. The restriction fragments corresponding to the wild-type Mll\nand the targeted Mll–AF9genes are 10 and 13 kb BglII fragments,\nrespectively. The probe used to detect homologous recombinationevents [1.5RXT2 (Corral et al., 1996)] is indicated. ( B) Filter\nhybridization of tail biopsy DNA. Lanes a–j show hybridization ofDNA extracted from a litter of Mll–AF9 mice produced by crossing amale chimera with a wild-type mouse. The DNA was digested withBglII and hybridized with the EcoRI–XhoI fragment from clone\np1.5RXT2. Two heterozygous carrier mice were present. 129 DNAcorresponds to a 129 mouse liver and B1-89 represents DNA from theoriginal Mll–AF9 targeted ES clone. Germline and targeted alleles areindicated.\nwere produced which developed haematopoietic tumours,\nmainly AML, after 6 months (Corral et al., 1996). Germ-\nlinetransmissionofthis Mll–AF9 fusiongenewasobtained\nby crossing chimeras with wild-type females. Hetero-zygotes obtained from these crosses were identiﬁed byﬁlter hybridization of somatic DNA using an internalprobe from the targeting region (1.5RXT2 probe, Figure1A). The probe detects a 10 kb germ-line Mllband and a\n13 kb band corresponding to the homologous recombin-ation fusion gene (Figure 1B shows the hybridization ofDNA from one litter, designated a–j, compared with 129liver DNA and DNA from an initial targeted ES cloneB1-89). No homozygous Mll–AF9 mice were found inany litter from a heterozygous cross (41 pups from fourlitters were analysed), indicating embryonic lethality ofthe knock-in gene as reported for the Mllnull mutant\nmice (Yu et al., 1995).\nOur previous report on the Mll–AF9 fusion gene\nexpressed in chimeric mice showed that most animalssuccumbed to acute leukaemia within one year (Corralet al., 1996). Whilst many of these were diagnosed as\nmyeloid, a complete analysis was not performed in allcases. A detailed investigation of the leukaemias in Mll–AF9 heterozygous and chimeric mice has now beenundertakentodeﬁnemorepreciselythetypeofmalignancyand to address issues relating to the mode of onset ofovert malignancy. Cohorts of Mll–AF9 mice were com-pared with mice which had been made with an epitopetag fused (this line of mice has been designated Mll–myc;Corralet al., 1996) at the same Mllexon 8 position at\nC.L.Dobson et al.\nFig. 2.Acute leukaemia occurrence in Mll–AF9 mice. The rate of\nleukaemia occurrence (age in months of detection of disease versusnumber of mice with disease) in Mll–AF9 chimeric and heterozygousmice. Diagnosis of leukaemia was obtained by histological analysis ofbone marrow, spleen, thymus and liver, and in most cases by FACSanalysis of cell surface marker expression. AML developed in 21 outof 28 heterozygous Mll–AF9 mice (circles), in 22 out of 24 Mll–AF9chimeras (squares) and ALL developed in two out of 24 Mll–AF9chimeras (diamonds). No Mll–myc heterozygous mice developed amalignancy in the 18 month period of this experiment (four tumourswere detected in the cohort of 27 Mll–myc mice but these occurred at28, 29, 32 and 32 months).\nwhich the AF9 sequences were fused. These groups were\nanalysed over a period of 18 months, and during this timeboth the Mll–AF9 chimeras and heterozygotes began toshow signs of distress. No disease was observed in Mll–myc mice within the 18 month experimental period (therewere27Mll–mycmiceinthecontrolgroup;fourdevelopedAML tumours but these occurred after two years sug-gesting that they were of sporadic origin rather than dueto the manipulation of the Mllgene).\nPost-mortem examination of Mll–AF9 mice showed\nconsistent evidence of haematological disease. Signsincluded pale femurs, splenomegaly, heptomegaly andpale kidneys. All the mice analysed were diagnosed ashaving acute leukaemias and no tumours of other tissueswere observed, despite widespread activity of the Mll\npromoter (Yu et al., 1995; Corral et al., 1996). The\ndevelopment of these acute leukaemias is shown inFigure 2. The disease was classiﬁed as predominantlyAML with rare examples of ALL, mirroring the spectrum\nand ratio of acute leukaemias found in humans with thechromosomal translocation t(9;11). The rate of develop-ment of AML was overall slightly faster in heterozygousanimals compared with the chimeras (Figure 2), the pointat which 50% of each cohort had succumbed to AMLbeing 5 and 7 months for heterozygotes and chimeras,respectively. Twenty-two of the 24 chimeras and 21 ofthe 28 heterozygous Mll–AF9 mice developed AML inthe 18 month period. Two Mll–AF9 chimeras developedALL rather than AML.\nAcute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia in\nMll–AF9 mice\nAlmost all Mll–AF9 heterozygous and chimeric mice\ndeveloped malignancy within one and a half years.\n3566Detailed tissue histology was carried out on mice as\npathological signs of disease developed, to classify thetypes of leukaemia present and to establish a diagnosis ofdisease. This analysis conﬁrmed the presence of acuteleukaemias in all the mice with symptoms and showed theoccurrence of either myeloid or lymphoid malignancies.Marked inﬁltration of leukaemic cells was seen in thebonemarrow,peripheralbloodandliverofMll–AF9mice.Figure 3 shows a comparison of the histology of tissuesfrom an Mll–myc mouse (Figure 3A) with those fromMll–AF9 mice. The AML was observed in two differentforms, overt myeloid leukaemia and extramedullary leuk-aemia. Mice exhibiting overt myeloid leukaemia weredistinguished by ù30% of nucleated cells in the bone\nmarrow being blasts. Heavy inﬁltration of the peripheralblood with myeloblasts was observed in these mice (eitherchimeras or heterozygotes). The myeloblasts were charac-terized by their large, granular appearance and werefrequentlyobservedintheliver(Figure3BshowshistologyfromaheterozygousmouseandFigure3Cshowshistologyfrom a chimeric mouse, both with AML). Other tissueswere also involved at this stage, for instance kidney. Thealternative form of myeloid disease was extramedullaryleukaemia (Figure3D), in whichextensive extramedullaryinﬁltration of myeloblasts was found in the liver, with\nperi-vascular deposits of malignant cells. In the exampleshown (histology from a chimeric mouse), the bonemarrowshowssigniﬁcantly ,30%inﬁltrationwithmyelo-\nblasts. Similarly, few abnormal cells were observed inthe peripheral blood in the extramedullary stage of themalignancy.\nDetailed analysis of tissue histology in the Mll–AF9\nmice (one example is shown in Figure 3E) indicated thattwo ALLs arose. In these mice the bone marrow sampleswere hypercellular, with normal haematopoiesis sup-pressed,and .90%ofthemononuclearcellswerelympho-\nblasts with many active mitoses seen. An enlarged thymuswas evident in these mice in addition to a pale femur,enlarged, pale spleen and pale kidneys. Extra-medullaryhaematopoiesis was evident in the liver which showed thecharacteristic peri-vascular accumulation of leukaemiccells. The circulating blood of the mouse shown is packedwith lymphoblasts. In addition, the peripheral blood ﬁlmindicates thatthis mousewas also sufferingfrom anaemia.\nImmunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis showed\nthat both of the ALLs were of B cell origin. Filterhybridization was carried out with an immunoglobulinheavy chain probe and spleen cell DNA of the two ALL-bearing mice compared with a myeloma cell line (J558)and a T cell line (BW) and kidney DNA from C57Bl/6and 129 mice (Figure 4A). The probe detects a 6.5 kbEcoRI germ-line band in the kidney DNA samples and\nthe BW (T cell) DNA, but detects two rearranged bandsin the myeloma (B cell) DNA representing heavy-chaingene rearrangements. DNA from both of the Mll–AF9tumours similarly had two distinct rearranged bandstogether with faint germ-line bands, indicative of clonalB cell tumours in these mice. Rearrangement of T cellreceptorβ-chain genes was also investigated with J β2 and\nCβ1 probes, but no rearrangements were found in the\ntumour DNA from either ALL mouse (data not shown).FACS analysis of bone marrow cells from mouse 1\nMll–AF9 fusion causes myeloproliferation\nFig. 3.Histology of leukaemias arising in Mll–AF9 mice. Histology was carried out on tissues from all mice with symptoms of disease. Tissues\nwere dissected and ﬁxed in 10% formalin.

Two Mll–AF9\nchimeric mice showed acute leukaemia (ages 11 and 12 months) withcells morphologically identiﬁed as lymphoblasts (see Figure 3E);mouse 1: number 4005, mouse 2: 4020. Bone marrow cells wereexamined by gene rearrangement using ﬁlter hybridization (A) andlymphoid surface marker expression (B) to specify the lineage.(A) Filter hybridization. DNA was extracted from the spleen of\nMll–AF9 mice, of J558 (myeloma) or BW (T) cells and of C57Bl/6 or129 kidney. DNA was digested with HindIII, separated by gel\nelectrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. The membraneswere hybridized with a radiolabelled immunoglobulin enhancer probe(Neuberger and Williams, 1986) and the washed ﬁlters autoradio-graphed at –70\n°C with pre-fogged ﬁlm. ( B) FACS analysis of Mll–\nAF9 mouse 4005 (mouse 1): bone marrow cells were prepared assingle cell suspensions from mouse 4005 or an age-matched wild-typemouse and were stained with ﬂuorescent antibodies recognizing theT cell marker CD4, the B cell marker B220 and the myeloid markerGr-1. Graphs represent cell number ( y-axis) versus ﬂuorescence\nintensity ( x-axis). Similar data were obtained with Mll–AF9 mouse\n4020 (mouse 2). No evidence of mixed lineage phenotype was foundfor either of the ALL tumour-bearing Mll–AF9 mice.\nconﬁrmedthatthetumourwascomprisedofpredominantly\nB220antigen-expressingBlymphocytes,whichareusuallyfound in low numbers in the bone marrow. In contrast,the normal constituents of the bone marrow (Figure 4B)suchasGr-1-orCD4-positivecellsaredepletedcomparedwithwild-typemousecontrols.Asimilarpatternofsurfacemarker expression was observed with bone marrow forALL mouse 2 (data not shown). No evidence of mixedlineage tumours was obtained. Glucose phosphate iso-merase (GPI) analysis (Papaioannou and Johnson, 1993)was performed on spleen samples from the two mice withALL to estimate the contribution originating from the\n3568CCB-derived ES cells, injected into the C57Bl/6 blasto-\ncysts. Both mice had signiﬁcant CCB ES cell contributionin thespleen (datanot shown)suggesting thatthe lympho-blastic tumours are of ES cell origin.\nMyeloproliferation is observed in Mll–AF9 mice\nprior to leukaemia occurrence\nThe normal function of Mll appears to be related to the\nembryonic developmental plan by affecting Hoxgene\nexpression proﬁles (Yu et al., 1995) and it may also have\na speciﬁc role in some aspects of haematopoiesis (Fidanzaet al., 1996; Hess et al., 1997). One of several possible\nroles for the tumour-speciﬁc MLL–AF9 fusion protein isan inﬂuence on the molecular interactions which areimportant for haematopoietic differentiation, which couldthus partly explain the predominant association of thechromosomal translocation t(9;11) with myeloid malig-nancies. A corollary of this is that the lineage from whichthe majority of tumours arise (i.e. the myeloid lineage) isselectively increased in the heterozygous Mll–AF9 mice.In order to assess this situation, we ﬁrst examined thesurface antigen phenotype of the myeloid tumours. Anti-bodiesbindingtosurfaceproteinsofmyeloidcells(Mac-1and Gr-1), B-lymphocytes (B220) and T lymphocytes(CD3 and CD4) were used to detect antigen expressionon spleen and bone marrow cells. On the whole, tumourcells were found in bone marrow and in spleen, and inmicewithAMLmalignantcellstypicallyexpressedMac-1and Gr-1 surface markers. Figure 5 shows FACS analysisof the bone marrow and spleen cells from a typical Mll–AF9 heterozygous mouse (mouse number 4299) withAML. The inﬁltration of Gr-1-positive tumour cells intothespleenpopulationisverymarkedwiththeconcomitantloss of B220\n1B cells and CD41T cells, compared with\nsplenocytes from a wild-type mouse. In the bone marrowthere was also a striking difference between AML-bearingmice and wild-type mice. In the latter, there are usually~50% Gr-1\n1cells exhibiting a narrow ﬂuoresence proﬁle\ncorresponding to mature myeloid cells, the ﬂuorescenceproﬁle of the Mll–AF9 mouse had a broad appearanceconsistentwiththerebeingmainlyimmaturemyeloidcells(Figure 5). A small population of B220\n1bone marrow\ncells found in the wild-type mouse was absent from theMll–AF9 mouse.\nThe examination of the Gr-1\n1/Mac-11population in\nyoung heterozygous Mll–AF9 mice was used as a basisfordeterminingwhetherapre-leukaemiceffectonmyeloidcelldifferentiationresultedfromthepresenceofthefusiongene. FACS analysis was carried out on young Mll–AF9mice using Gr-1 and Mac-1 (myeloid markers), Ter119(erythrocyte marker), B220 (B cell marker), CD4(T cell marker), Thy 1.2 (T-lymphocytes, monocytes,B-lymphocytes), Sca-1 (multipotent haematopoietic stemcells, mature myeloid cells), CD44 (leukocytes, erythro-cytes,epithelia)andc-Kit(haematopoieticprogenitorcellsand mast cells). Only effects on the myeloid markers weredetectable. Bone marrow from Mll–AF9 heterozygousmice of either 6 days or 5 weeks of age were analysedand compared with either wild-type or Mll–myc mice ofsimilar age (Figure 6). While there was a modest increasein Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive cells in the Mll–AF9 bonemarrow compared with the two controls at 6 days of age\nMll–AF9 fusion causes myeloproliferation\nFig. 5.Surface phenotype of AMLs in Mll–AF9 mice. Mll–AF9 mice with signs of disease were sacriﬁced and single cell suspensions were made\nfrom the spleen and bone marrow. Cells were stained with ﬂuorescent antibodies recognizing the myeloid marker, Gr-1, the T cell markers, CD3 andCD4, and the B cell marker, B220. Twelve out of 24 Mll–AF9 chimeras and 15 out of 28 Mll–AF9 heterozygotes were analysed. In therepresentative example shown, the Mll–AF9 heterozygous mouse 4299 developed AML (age 4 months) and FACS analysis was performed andcompared with a wild-type mouse of comparable age. Graphs represent cell number ( y-axis) versus ﬂuorescence intensity ( x-axis).\n(35% compared with 21 and 15% for wild-type and Mll–\nmyc mice, respectively), a much larger population (~85%)was observed in the Mll–AF9 mice at 5 weeks comparedwith either the wild-type (48%) or the Mll–myc (54%)mice. The Gr-1\n1cells in the Mll–AF9 heterozygotes seem\nto represent a true increase in myeloid lineage cells, ratherthan overtly leukaemic cells. This is indicated by thenarrow ﬂuorescence proﬁle which is similar to those ofthe control mice (wild type or Mll–myc; Figure 6),as compared with the broad proﬁle found with AMLbone marrow.\nThese data indicate that an early proliferation of cells\nin the myeloid lineage, driven by the Mll–AF9 fusionprotein, occurs prior to the development of malignancy.The increase in proportion of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positivecells in Mll–AF9 heterozygous mice at 6 days of agecompared with wild-type or heterozygous Mll–myc micewas veriﬁed using cells obtained from 6 day pups fromlitters obtained by mating heterozygous Mll–myc orheterozygous Mll–AF9 mice. The bone marrow cells wereanalysed by FACS and the percentage of Mac-1/Gr-1double-positive cells determined (Figure 7A). In theselitters, there were four Mll–AF9 heterozygous mice, threeof which had high Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive cell counts\n3569comparedwiththe 1/–Mll–mycor 1/1littermates.Thus,\na high Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive count is predictive ofMll–AF9 heterozygosity soon after birth. As the numberof Mac-1/Gr-1 bone marrow cells naturally increases asmicemature,weexaminedgroupsoflittermatesatbetween5and12 weeksofageinwhichenvironmentaldisturbancesshould be less signiﬁcant. In this analysis, we examinedbone marrow cells from seven Mll–AF9 1/– mice, eight\nwild-type 1/1mice (Figure 7B) and 14 Mll–myc 1/–\nmice (Figure 7C). Of the seven Mll–AF9 heterozygousmice analysed, the proportion of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive cells in the bone marrow ranged from 71–93%,with an average of 82%. These ﬁgures are consistentlyhigher than those we observed for wild-type mice (Figure7B), in which the average number of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive cells is 52%; one mouse had 77% double-positivebone marrow cells but this was exceptional. Furthermore,the 14 Mll–myc heterozygous mice had an average of50% Mac-1/Gr-1 bone marrow cells, ranging from 43–60%. The standard errors from these cohorts of mice werecalculated at 3, 4 and 1.2% for Mll–AF9, 1/1wild-type\nand Mll–myc mice, respectively, indicating a signiﬁcantproliferative advantage for the myeloid cell compartmentin the bone marrow of the Mll–AF9 mice. Only the\nC.L.Dobson et al.\nFig. 6.Young Mll–AF9 mice exhibit increased myeloproliferation. Mll–AF9 heterozygous mice were analysed at 6 days or 5 weeks of age to\ndetermine the status of haematopoietic differentiation, prior to the development of overt leukaemia. Mice were selected from litters of Mll–AF9,Mll–myc and wild-type mice at 6 days or 5 weeks of age and single cell suspensions were made from the bone marrow. Cells were stained with ananti-Mac-1 antibody coupled with phycoerythrin (PE) together with an anti-Gr-1 antibody coupled with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to detectthe myeloid population of cells.

The peaks of ﬂuorescence intensity for wild-type and Mll–AF9 mouse bone marrow cells are similar indicating theseare not transformed myeloid cells (compared with the AML bone marrow shown in Figure 5) at the stage of analysis, but rather there is an increasein myeloid cell compartment size.\npresence of the Mll–AF9gene fusion was capable of\neliciting this change, and not the truncation of the Mll\ngene by addition of the myc epitope. Thus, one function\n3570of theMll–AF9fusion gene appears to be to confer a\nproliferative advantage for cells of the myeloid lineage,prior to the onset of AML.\nMll–AF9 fusion causes myeloproliferation\nFig. 7.Mll–AF9 mice exhibit myeloproliferation prior to development\nof overt leukaemia. The cell populations of bone marrow, from miceaged 6 days or between 5 and 12 weeks, were analysed by ﬂowcytometry. Single cell suspensions were made from the bone marrowand cells stained with an anti-Mac-1 antibody coupled with PEtogether with an anti-Gr-1 antibody coupled with FITC. Data areexpressed as the percentage of double staining cells. Genotypes weredetermined by ﬁlter hybridization of DNA from tail biopsies.(A) Histogram showing the percentage of Gr-1\n1Mac-11cells in the\nbone marrow of individual 6 day old mice from one litter of aheterozygous Mll–myc cross (nine pups) and one litter of Mll–AF9mated with a wild-type mouse (12 pups).

The propensity of the MLLgene to form\nfusiongenesafterchromosomaltranslocationsisimportantbecause .15% of all acute leukaemias in man have MLL\ngene fusions and because there is an association ofparticular MLLfusions with particular subtypes of acute\nleukaemia.Forinstance, MLL–AF4/FEL fusionsaretypic-\nally found in lymphoblastic tumours, whereas MLL–AF9fusions are typically found in myeloid tumours (Djabaliet al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993; Iida\net al., 1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura et al.,\n1993). This implies a speciﬁc role for the chimeric proteinin determination of the type of leukaemia which develops.Nonetheless, an alternative possibility is based purely onmechanism and accessibility of genes in chromosomes.Thus the ability of MLLandAF9orMLLandAF4\ngenomic regions to take part in an inter-chromosomaltranslocation may be greater in committed myeloid orlymphoid cells, respectively. The alternative models canbe assessed using animal models of disease in which genefusion is either controlled by speciﬁc interchromosomalevents (Smith et al., 1995; van Deursen et al., 1995) or\nby knock-in of the fusion gene partner (Thomas andCapecchi, 1987; Corral et al., 1996). We have developed\nand analysed a model for MLL–AF9-induced leukaemiausinghomologousrecombinationtoknock-inthe AF9into\nthe endogenous mouse Mllgene (Corral et al., 1996). In\nthis model system, we ﬁnd that the fusion causes tumoursin both chimeric mice and mice heterozygous for the Mll–\nAF9fusion gene. The majority of tumours observed in\nthese mice were myeloid as has been reported in humanswith chromosomal translocation t(9;11). Two acutelymphoblastic tumours also arise reﬂecting the relativeoccurrenceofAML:ALLinhumans.Intheknock-inmice,the ALL cases occurred with a longer latency than theacute myeloid tumours.\nThe pathological features of the haematopoietic malig-\nnancies in the Mll–AF9 mice were very similar to thoseof human MLL–AF9 associated tumours, providing astriking counterpart between the pathology of the murineand human leukaemias associated with the t(9;11). Inman, the most common French-American-British (FAB)subtypesfoundinthiscontextareAML,M5(monoblastic/monocytic), M4 (myelomonocytic), and occasionally M1or M2 (Bain, 1993). Comparable morphologies wereevident in the mice used in the investigation. The patternof organ inﬁltration described in the mice has closesimilarities to the clinical ﬁndings in man. Thus, enlarge-ment of the superﬁcial lymph nodes, liver and spleen iscommon in human AML, with 90% of cases showinginﬁltration of the liver and spleen at autopsy. Extramedul-lary inﬁltration of leukaemic myeloblasts is most commonin monocytic or myelomonocytic leukaemia. Althoughusually diffuse, disease may occur as tumorous deposits(granulocytic sarcoma). This may be the initial manifesta-\nC.L.Dobson et al.\ntion of AML, with the appearance of the disease in\nthe bone marrow following later if the patient remainsuntreated. Hepatic inﬁltration by leukaemic myeloblastsin the absence of heavy marrow disease was a recurrentfeature of the t(9;11) leukaemia in our mice. Since themice in our experimental group develop a malignancywhich mimics the disease occurring in humans with thetranslocation t(9;11), they could be used to test therapieswhich might later be applicable to human cancermanagement.\nAn early effect of Mll–AF9 on myeloproliferation\nVariousfusionpartnerscanbelinkedtothe MLLgeneafter\nthe formation of the abnormal chromosomes (reviewed inRowley, 1993; Bernard and Berger, 1995; Rubnitz et al.,\n1996b; Gilliland, 1998). However, it is not clear whetherthetimingofthetranslocationisimportantfordeterminingthe type of leukaemia which develops or whether theincomingfusionpartnerhasanimportantroleindetermin-ing the nature of the tumour. We have found that myelo-proliferation occurs prior to the acute myeloid disease thatarisesinmostMll–AF9mice.Thesedatathereforesuggestthat the disease in the majority of animals initiates in aproliferating pool of myeloblasts from which leukaemicprecursors arise as a result of secondary mutations. Thesurviving Mll–AF9 mice without tumours are presumbalyones in which secondary mutations have not occurred.Thus, our observations with the Mll–AF9 knock-in micesuggest that the role of the MLL–AF9fusion is to specify\nlineage. However, a number of other factors need to betaken into account. No signﬁcant numbers of tumoursarose in Mll–myc mice (Corral et al., 1996) and further\nstudy showed that four out of 27 mice developed AMLafter two years. Similarly, no signiﬁcant numbers of micedeveloped tumours when the lacZgene was fused to\nexon 3 of Mll(Corralet al., 1996). However, we have\nrecently found that fusion of Mllexon 8 with lacZresults\nin the occurrence of AML (C.L.Dobson, A.J.Warren,A.Forster, R.Pannell and T.H.Rabbitts, unpublished) butwithamuchlongerlatencythanseenwith Mll–AF9fusion\nmice. This implies that formation of a stable MLL fusionprotein per se is sufﬁcient for tumorigenesis and thatfusion of MllwithAF9in mice has an accelerating\nfunction due to speciﬁcation of the myeloid lineage cellpopulation.\nA further complicating issue is that a small proportion\noftheMll–AF9micedeveloplymphoblasticmalignancies,as do humans with the t(9;11) translocation. This wouldsuggest that the chromosomal translocation does notusually occur in a committed myeloid progenitor cell butrather in an early progenitor, which retains the ability todifferentiate along lymphoid or myeloid lineages and thusform tumours of either type. The latency of the tumoursin Mll–AF9 mice suggests that secondary mutations mustbe occurring prior to overt leukaemia. The corollary isthat different mutations are likely to accompany lymphoidas opposed to myeloid leukaemia. Furthermore, at leastone of these must occur early for a lymphoid tumour toarise, as the myeloproliferation conferred by the MLL–\nAF9fusionwouldpresumablycommitthemajorityofcells\nbeyond the boundary for lymphoid tumour development.These arguments suggest that other major recurring MLLfusions, such as with AF4/FEL or ENL/LTG19 also\n3572function to specify the lineage of the tumours, which\nexplains why there is such a strong association betweenthese fusions and lymphoblastic tumours (Gu et al., 1992;\nDomeret al., 1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura\net al., 1993; Yamamoto et al., 1993; Downing et al., 1994;\nRubnitzet al., 1996a). In the case of MLL–ENL fusions,\nretroviral transduction experiments with mouse bonemarrow cells have clearly shown that a gain-of-functionmechanism is operational (Lavau et al., 1997; Slany\net al., 1997) and that myeloid differentiation and myeloid\ntransformation are paramount. Therefore, the spectrum ofmutations in other genes, which must occur in cells withchromosomal translocations involving the MLLgene, may\nwelldifferinthecontextoftumourtypeswiththedifferentMLLfusions. The nature of these mutations, the pattern\nof perturbation of gene expression and the biologicalconsequences of AF4fusion with MLLare now our major\nobjectives.\nMaterials and methods\nConstruction of the targeting vectors and analysis of\ntargeted ES cells\nThe plasmid constructs for gene targeting have been described (Corralet al., 1996). Mll–AF9 comprises a knock-in of the AF9short form (Iida\net al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993) into exon 8 of the mouse Mllgene\nwhilst Mll–myc comprises a knock-in of a short epitope tag into thesame location in exon 8. CCB ES cells were transfected with the Mll–AF9 targeting vector DNA as described previously (Warren et al., 1994).\nHomologous recombination was assessed by ﬁlter hybridization of BglII\ndigested DNA using the EcoRI–XhoI fragment from clone p1.5RXT2\nas a probe. The presence of a single insertion site was conﬁrmed witha neomycin probe. Targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57Bl/6blastocysts, which were transferred into recipient females. Chimericmice thereby generated were estimated by coat colour. Heterozygousmice were obtained for both Mll–AF9andMll–myc fusion genes by\ncrossing chimeric males with wild-type MF1 females.\nMouse pathology\nLeukaemia development in mice was characterized by indolent habit,hunched gait and rufﬂed hair. On developing sickness, mice were culledand a post-mortem carried out. Tissues were taken for analysis and wereﬁxed in 10% formalin and embedded in parafﬁn wax. Blocks weresectioned and slides were processed and stained with haematoxylin andeosin (H&E) by routine techniques. Blood ﬁlms were stained with May–Giemsa–Gru ¨nwald (MGG) stain. Slides were photographed using Kodak\nTungsten 160 ﬁlm. Glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) isozyme analysiswas performed on spleen samples as described previously (Papaioannouand Johnson, 1993).\nImmunoglobulin gene rearrangement assays\nDNA was prepared from various tissues using standard procedures. TheDNA was digested with HindIII, and fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels,\ntransferred to nylon membranes (Southern, 1975) and hybridized withrandomly labelled probe (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). An immuno-globulinheavychainenhancer probeoriginatingfromtheintronbetweenJHandCµgene segments (Neuberger and Williams, 1986) was used.\nFor T cell rearrangement, DNA was digested with EcoRI orHindIII and\nﬁlter hybridizations carried out with probes for either J β2o rCβ1\n(Malissen et al., 1984).\nFlow-cytometric analysis of cell surface marker expression\nSingle-cell suspensions were prepared from mouse thymus, spleen and\nbonemarrow.Cells(100 µl;53107/ml)wereincubatedat4°Cfor20 min\nin phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) withthe following antibodies (PharMingen, San Diego, CA): anti-Gr-1 andanti-Mac-1 (granulocytes), anti-B220 (B cells), anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 (T cells), anti-Ter119 (erythrocytes), anti-c-Kit (haematopoieticprogenitor cells), anti-Thy 1.2 (T lymphocytes, monocytes, B lympho-cytes), anti-CD44 (leukocytes, erythrocytes, epithelia) and anti-Sca-1(multipotent haematopoietic stem cells). Antibodies were conjugatedwith either ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), or phycoerythrin (PE).\nMll–AF9 fusion causes myeloproliferation\nIsotype-matched ﬂuoresceinated antibodies were used as controls for\nnon-speciﬁc immunoﬂuorescence. After antibody labelling, cells werewashed once with PBS containing 5% FCS and resuspended in 1 mlof PBS/5% FCS. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using aFACSCALIBUR (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data analysis wasperformed with Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson). Each phenotype analysiswas generated by analysis of 10 000 cells.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the MRC and partly by a grant from theKay Kendall Leukaemia Research Fund.

    "paragraph": "RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access\nGene profiling of the erythro- and\nmegakaryoblastic leukaemias induced by the\nGraffi murine retrovirus\nVeronique Voisin1,2, Philippe Legault1, Diana Paulina Salazar Ospina1, Yaacov Ben-David2, Eric Rassart1*\nAbstract\nBackground: Acute erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias are associated with very poor prognoses and the\nmechanism of blastic transformation is insufficiently elucidated. The murine Graffi leukaemia retrovirus induces\nerythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias when inoculated into NFS mice and represents a good model to study\nthese leukaemias.\nMethods: To expand our understanding of genes specific to these leukaemias, we compared gene expression\nprofiles, measured by microarray and RT-PCR, of all leukaemia types induced by this virus.\nResults: The transcriptome level changes, present between the different leukaemias, led to the identification of\nspecific cancerous signatures. We reported numerous genes that may be potential oncogenes, may have a\nfunction related to erythropoiesis or megakaryopoiesis or have a poorly elucidated physiological role. The\nexpression pattern of these genes has been further tested by RT-PCR in different samples, in a Friend\nerythroleukaemic model and in human leukaemic cell lines.\nWe also screened the megakaryoblastic leukaemias for viral integrations and identified genes targeted by these\nintegrations and potentially implicated in the onset of the disease.\nConclusions: Taken as a whole, the data obtained from this global gene profiling experiment have provided a\ndetailed characterization of Graffi virus induced erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias with many genes\nreported specific to the transcriptome of these leukaemias for the first time.\nBackground\nHuman acute megakaryoblastic (FAB-AML7, [1]) and\nerythroleukaemias (FAB-AML6, [2]) are regarded as\nrelatively rare entities of acute myeloid leukaemia but\nare associated with a very poor prognosis [3-7]. The\npoor outcome linked to these 2 types of leukaemias\nstems from a combination of failure to achieve complete\nremission, a high relapse rate and therapy-related toxi-\ncity, highlighting the need for more powerful therapies.\nFurthermore, AML6 or AML7 diagnosis represents a\ngreater challenge than other types of acute myeloid leu-\nkaemia (AML) and additional markers are needed [8].\nFurthermore, the blasts of patients with AML6 and\nAML7 share common markers [9] indicating that theyoriginate from closely related haematopoietic lineages\nderived from a common bipotent progenitor [10,11].\nWe have recently shown that the murine retrovirus\nGraffi is able to induce a broad spectrum of leukaemias\nwhen inoculated into newborn mice. The leukaemias\ndeveloped by these mice are of lymphoid (T-cell and\nB-cell) and non lymphoid (myeloid, erythroid and mega-\nkaryoblastic) origins. The incidence of erythro- and\nmegakaryoblastic leukaemias is particularly high in NFS\nor FVB/n mice inoculated with the GV-1.4 variant of\nthe Graffi virus [12]. The activation of the targeted\nproto-oncogene or the repression of tumor suppressor\ngenes represents early events in the development of the\nmurine leukaemia retrovirus (MuLV) induced leukae-\nmia. It is then followed by a deregulation of numerous\nadditional genes resulting in a cell, blocked at a very\nimmature stage, which aggre ssively divides and escapes\napoptosis.

These analyses highlightmany genes that may be potential oncogenes and mayhave a function related to erythropoiesis or megakaryo-poiesis. The results support the importance of the\nknown transcription factors Gata1 ,Fog1 ,Fli1,Scland\nLmo2 in both erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias\nand the role of Runx1 ,Pbx1 ,Meis ,Evi1 andEvi3 in the\nmegakaryoblastic leukaemias. Moreover, numerousgenes are being reported for the first time and some ofthese genes are candidate oncogenes: Fgf3,Nmyc ,Fap,\nMyct1 ,Gucy1a3 ,Gulp1 andFkbp9 specific to megakar-\nyoblastic leukaemias and Ssx2ip ,Rab11a, Ncoa3 ,Snca ,\nLtbp2 ,Rabgef1 and Btbd14a specific to erythroleukae-\nmias. A screening for viral integrations was performedin mouse tumors. Several genes, amongst which Kit,\nGata2 ,Irf8 and Itga1 , were identified as potentially\nimplicated in the onset development of the megakaryo-blastic leukaemias.\nMethods\nVirus production and mice\nGV-1.4 viral stock was made as previously described [12].GV-1.4 viral particles (0.1 ml at a titer of 1.10\n6PFU/ml)\nwere injected into 1 day newborn NFS mice. The micewere checked routinely for clinical signs of disease andmoribund mice were sacrificed. Twenty-four diseasedmice and 36 control mice were used for the microarrayand RT-PCR experiments. Bone marrow cell suspension\nwas prepared by flushing the femurs with IMDM 2% foe-\ntal bovine serum (FBS) and sp leen cell suspension was\nprepared by mincing the spleen with scissors and aspirat-ing the pieces up and down through a 1cc syringe inIMDM 2% FBS. The spleen and bone marrow cell sus-pensions were filtered through 70 μm cell strainers (Bec-\nton Dickson, Mississauga, Canada). All the experimentalprocedures are conformed to the Helsinki Declaration\na n dw e r ea p p r o v e db yt h eA n i m a lC a r ea n dU s eC o m -\nmittees of Université du Québec à Montréal.\nFlow cytometry analyses and cell sorting\nThe flow cytometry staining procedure was performed aspreviously described [12]. The antibodies used were as\nfollows: CD4, CD8a, CD3, CD90, CD19, B220, CD11b,Gr1, CD71, Ter119, CD41, Kit and Sca1 (BD Pharmin-\ngen, Mississauga, Canada). The leukaemic populations\nwere isolated from the haematopoietic organs by positiveselection using magnetic beads with the EasySep Kit(StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) accordingto the manufacturer ’s protocol. The rates of purity and\nviability of the sorted cells were fixed to be equal to orgreater than 95%. Leukaemic T-cells were sorted fromthe thymus of leukaemic NFS mice, B-cell from theenlarged lymph nodes and erythro- and megakaryoblastic\nleukaemic cells were sorted from the infiltrated spleen.Control cells were sorted from the haematopoietic organsof 12 pooled non-infected NFS mice: T-cells wereobtained from the thymus, B-cells from the spleen, anderythroblasts from the bone marrow.\nRNA extraction and microarray processing\nTotal RNA was extracted from the sorted cell popula-tions with Trizol reagent (I nvitrogen, Burlington,\nCanada) followed by column purification using the Qia-gen RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Canada) and\nprocessed for hybridizatio n to Affymetrix GeneChip®\nM o u s eG e n o m e4 3 02 . 0a r r a y s( G e n o m eQ u e b e cI n n o -\nvation Centre, Montreal, Canada).\nData analysis\nData Set Normalization: Affymetrix MicroArray Suite\nversion 5.0 was used to scan and quantify the arrays.Normalization of gene expression data were performedusing the Bioconductor implementation of RMA\n(Robust Multi Array, B. Bolstad, University of California,\nBerkeley) available from the Flexarray software (1.2,\nR 2.7.2, [13]).\nUnsupervised learning: Hierarchical clustering (com-\nplete linkage clustering, correlation uncentered, [14])and Self-Organization Maps (SOM, parameters G 1-5, A1-10, [15]) were constructed using GeneCluster software(M. Eisen). 3,000 transcripts were selected to beincluded in the analyses based on the differential expres-\nsion from the mean. The deviation from the mean was\ncalculated from the RMA values of the 45,000 probesetsand the data were ranked in decreasing order to extractthe first 3,000 genes. Only deviations equal or above0.585 (1.5 fold change) and equal or below -0.585 (-1.5fold change) were considered as significant.\nSupervised learning: Signifi cance Analysis of microar-\nrays (SAM, [16]). SAM analyses were performed using\nFlexarray software using the normalized data of the\n45,000 probesets. Data with p-values equal or below 0.01and False Discover Rates (Benjamini Hochberg) equal orbelow 0.20 were included in further analyses. The datawere ranked in decreasing order of the SAM d-score toobtain the list of the differentially expressed genes.\nThe NetAffx website (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA,\nUSA) was used to retrieve gene ontology (GO) annota-\ntions, probe sequences, and was utilized as a link to\nUnigene (NCBI) for further functional studies.\nThe microarray dataset was deposited at Gene Expres-\nsion Omnibus under accession number [GSE12581].\nCell line and differentiation assay\nThe murine erythroleukaemic cell line HB22.2 wasobtained from murine erythroblasts infected with FriendVoisin et al.BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:2\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/2Page 2 of 17\nMurine Leukaemia Virus (F-MuLV) [17]. This cell line\nwas maintained in alpha minimum essential medium(a-MEM) supplemented with 1 0% (FBS) (Invitrogen,\nFrederick, MD) plus a penic illin/streptomycin cocktail.\nTo induce differentiation, HB22.2 cells were incubatedin the presence of hemin (Sigma-aldrich H5533) at a\nconcentration of 100 μM. The cells were harvested 24\nhours and 72 hours after addition of hemin. K562(ATCC, USA), HEL (ATCC, USA), Jurkat (ATCC, USA)and Tk6 (ATCC, USA) cells were grown in RMPI sup-plemented with 10% FBS plus a penicillin/streptomycincocktail.

Berns and colleagues[18]. Tumor DNA from the spleen (10 μg) was digested\nwith BamHI (New England Biolabs, Pickering, Canada). A\nsplinkerette adaptor was generated by annealing 2 oligo-\nnucleotides (5 ’CATGGGCTAAAGAGGACTAATAA-\nCAAGCGTGGCTGAATGAGACTGGTGTCGA CAC-TAGTGG3 ’,5 ’GATCCCACTAGTGTCGACACCAGT-\nCTCTAATTTTTTTTTTC AAAAAAA3 ’,9 5 ° C5m i n ,\ncool-down to room temperature). 1 μgo fd i g e s t e dD N A\nwas ligated to the splinkerette oligonucleotide (molar ratioDNA/splinkerette 1:10) using a T4 DNA ligase (NewEngland Biolabs, Pickering, Canada). The ligated product\nwas then digested with ClaI (New England Biolabs, Picker-ing, Canada). A PCR followed by a nested PCR (150 ng ofthe ligated product) were performed using a primerlocated in the Graffi virus U3 sequence (5 ’GGTCTC-\nTTGAAA-CTGCTGAGGG 3 ’and 5 ’GACCTTGATCT-\nGAACTT-CCCTATTC3 ’) and one corresponding to the\nsplinkerette oligonucleotide. The PCR program was thefollowing: 94°C for 1 min, 68°C for 30 s (2 cycles), 94°C for15 s, 58°C for 30 s, 72°C 3 min (27 cycles), 72°C 10 min.The PCR products were cloned (PCR Cloning Kit, Qiagen,Mississauga, Canada,) and sent for sequencing (GenomeQuebec Innovation Centre, Montreal, Canada). Thesequences were subjected to BLAST analysis against the\nannotated mouse genome database using Ensembl Gen-\nome Browser (release 45).\nResults\nErythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias induced by the\nmurine Graffi retrovirus and hybridization on microarrays\nNFS newborn mice inoculated with the Graffi murine\nretrovirus develop an average of 20% of erythroleukemia\nand 20% of megakaryoblastic leukemias with a latency\nof about 148 days [12]. These mice suffer from severeanaemia and hepatosplenomegaly. The erythroleukaemiccells, Ter119\n+CD71+, and the megakaryoblastic leukae-\nmic cells, CD41+Kit+or CD41-Kit+, are mainly found in\nt h eb o n em a r r o wa n ds p l e e no ft h ed i s e a s e dm i c e[ 1 2 ] .As opposed to Graffi-lymphoid leukaemias, the presenceof blast cells is rare in blood smears of both erythro-\nand megakaryoblastic leukaemias, consistent with clini-\ncal data on human acute erythroleukaemia [8].\nTo gain insight into the cancerous signatures of the\ndifferent leukaemias induced by Graffi MuLV, microar-ray experiments were designed to compare the expres-sion signature of genes from each type of leukaemia.Cells from the infiltrated haematopoietic organs of theleukaemic mice were isolated (Additional file 2) and\nsubjected to microarray analy sis. Unsupervised learning\nmethods, hierarchical clustering, and SOM analyseswere used to uncover the primary pattern in the data(Figure 1). Altogether, four distinct gene clusters repre-senting T-cells (T), B-cells (B), megakaryoblastic/mye-\nloid cells (Mk/M) and erythroid cells (E) emerged fromthe clustering (Figure 1A).\nA more detailed SOM analysis performed on the ery-\nthroid and megakaryoblastic genes further classified\nthem into 3 major signatures: erythroid-megakaryoblas-tic EMk (19%), erythroid E (42%) and megakaryoblasticMk (39%) (Figure 1B). E and Mk represent the genes\nover-expressed in the erythro- and megakaryoblasticleukaemias, respectively, and EMk represents the genesspecifically over-expressed in both types. MkE1 indicatesgenes over-expressed in the 3 megakaryoblasticVoisin et al.BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:2\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/2Page 3 of 17\nleukaemias (Mk1-Mk3) and the erythroleukaemia E1.\nSimilarly, EMk3 corresponds to genes over-expressed in3 erythroleukaemias (E1-E3) and the megakaryoblasticleukaemia Mk3. These results indicate that the leukae-mias E1 and Mk3 are biphenotypic and express botherythroid and megakaryoblastic markers, which was pre-\nviously observed in some Graffi-induced erythro- and\nmegakaryoblastic leukaemias [12]. The MkMB signatureincludes genes over-expressed in megakaryoblastic leu-kaemias (Mk1-Mk3), myeloid leukaemia (M) and B-cellleukaemias (B1-B3). A detailed analysis of Mk, E and\nEMk signatures has revealed that many of the geneshave not yet been reported in relation to the erythroidor the megakaryocytic lineages or to the correspondingleukaemias. The complete lists of genes detailing thesenon-lymphoid signatures are publicly available at http://\nwww.biomed.uqam.ca/rassart/microarray.html[19].\nThe lineage specific expression of genes involved in\nheme biosynthesis, the megakaryocytic fibrinogen recep-tors and the expression of well known transcription fac-tors validate the true lineage of these erythro- andmegakaryoblastic leukaemias (Table 1).\nThe megakaryoblastic signature\nThe megakaryoblastic speci fic genes assigned with a\nfunctional annotation (GO terms) were divided into dif-ferent functional classes. Table 2 lists some genes poten-tially implicated in the disease but the complete data arereadily available [19]. Within this list of genes, the onco-genes Meis1 (Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 ),\nPbx1 (Pre B-cell leukaemia transcription factor 1 ),Evi1\n(ecotropic viral integration site 1 ),Evi3 (Zfp521 ,zinc fin-\nger protein 521 ) and the co-repressor Cbfa2t3h (Core-\nbinding factor, runt domain, alpha subunit 2, translo-\ncated to, 3 (human), Eto2 ) have already been related to\nmegakaryoblastic leukaemias or megakaryocytic lineage[20-25].\nHowever, several other genes, for example Nmyc\n(Neuroblastoma myc-related oncogene 1 ),Fgf3 (Fibro-\nblast growth factor 3 )a n d Fap (Fibroblast activation\nprotein ), that are also known oncogenes [26-29], have\nnever been reported with megakaryoblastic leukaemias.Myct1 (Myc target 1 ) is also potentially implicated in\nthe disease as it is positively regulated by Myc and con-\ntains tumorigenic properties by itself [30].\nAmong the list of genes identified as the MkMB sig-\nnature, we found Jun(Jun oncogene ),Fosl2 (Fos-like\nantigen 2 )a n d Fes(Feline sarcoma oncogene )( T a b l e2 ,\n[31,32]). The co-repressor Ctbp2 (C-terminal binding\nprotein 2 ),Sfpi1 (SFFV proviral integration 1 ,PU.1 )a n d\nKit(Kit oncogene ) are also MkMB signature elements.\nCtbp2 is known to interact with Evi1 and Fog [33]. Sfpi1\nwas shown to regulate the expression of the integrin\naIIb(Itga2B , CD41) in a TPO-induced Mpl-UT7 model\n[34,35] and it was reported as an insertional target ofthe Graffi MuLV [36].\nDue to technical limitations, no megakaryoblastic con-\ntrol was present in our study. Normal megakaryocytes andtherefore megakaryoblasts represent a minor population innormal mice and it was not possible to obtain enough pur-ified cells with the technique utilized for other samples.We therefore compared our dataset to a study of murinemegakaryocytic maturation indicating up- or down-regula-tion during differentiation (dataset GSE6593, [37]).\nT1T2\nT3\nB2\nB1\nB3\nMk1\nMk3\nMk2\nM\nE1\nE2\nE3T1T2\nT3\nB2\nB1\nB3\nMk1\nMk3\nMk2\nM\nE1\nE2\nE3A B\nT\nBMk M\nE\nT2\nT1\nB3\nB2\nB1\nM\nMk2\nE1\nE2\nE3Mk1\nMk3T2\nT1\nB3\nB2\nB1\nM\nMk2\nE1\nE2\nE3Mk1\nMk3T3\nMk only\nMkE1\nMkM\nMkMB\nE only\nEMk3\nEMkMk\nE39%\n42%\n19%\nFigure 1 Hierarchical clustering and data scatter .

Many of these genes were membranereceptors and extra-cellular factors known to be\nexpressed by antigen presenting cells (APC) as well asimplicated in inflammatory response [19]. For example,\nTlr2 (Toll-like receptor 2 ),Tlr4 (toll-like receptor 4 ),Syk\n(Spleen tyrosine kinase) and Ebi3 (Epstein-Barr virus\ninduced gene 3 ) are part of the Toll-like receptor signal-\ning pathway to respond to microbial stimuli (LPS) andinduce inflammation (Table 2).

Within these genes, Kitand Gata2 were tested\ndue to their important roles in haematopoiesis. Theother genes were selected for experimentation since theyhad no prior association with megakaryocytic lineages orwith the corresponding leukaemia and also since theirfunction remained poorly studied (Table 2, ‘Genes\nselected for RT-PCR validation ’). Within these genes,\nGulp1 (Engulfment adaptor PTB domain containing 1 )andGucy1a3 (Guanylate cyclase 1, soluble, alpha 3 ) gave\nthe highest specificity in the RT-PCR experiments with astrong expression in the 3 me gakaryoblastic leukaemias\n(Figure 2).

In the Welch et al study, thegenes that displayed increased expression during differ-\nentiation tended to be under-expressed in the Graffi-induced erythroleukaemi as compared to the control\nsample and vice-versa. This suggests that the Graffi-\ninduced erythroleukaemias are blocked in an earlierstage than the control sample taken from a populationof Ter119\n+CD71+erythroblasts in the bone marrow.\nTable 3 provides examples of this correlation between\nthe two studies.

Rab11a\n(RAB11a, member RAS oncogene family ) was reported to\nregulate the recycling of the transferrin receptor [46]. Thisprotein interacts with Evi5 [47] and has a potential role incancer [48].

Rabgef1 is specifically expressed in the ery-\nthroleukaemias at 25 PCR cycles (lane a) but was ampli-fied in all samples at 28 PCR cycles (lane b). Gata1 is\nequally highly expressed in the erythroid and in themegakaryoblastic leukaemias (Figure 3).\nRT-PCR validation in a Friend virus murine\nerythroleukaemia cell line\nThe expression of the erythroid and megakaryoblastic\nspecific transcripts valid ated by RT-PCR (Figures 2 and3) was further assessed on a different erythroid model\n(Figure 4). The erythroleukaemia cell line HB22.2 hasbeen derived from a leukaemia induced by the FriendMurine Leukaemia virus (F-MuLV) and it presents avery immature erythroid phenotype (Kit\n+CD71+Ter119-\nCD41-) ([17]). The 6 erythroid genes ( Slamf1 ,Snca ,\nLtbp2 ,Rabgef1 ,Cda and Btbd14a ) are expressed in\nHB22.2 but the intensity of the Ltbp2 and Btdb14a\nbands were weaker (Figure 4A). In accordance with ourexpectations, the megakaryoblastic genes, Ncf2,Gucy1a3\nand Gulp1 , could not be amplified. Fkbp9 is the only\nmegakaryoblastic gene that gave a weak signal in thiserythroid cell line. Indeed, Fkbp9 showed the strongest\nerythroid amplification in the RT-PCR validation experi-\nment (Figure 2). Thus, these results show that, despite\nthe close relationship between erythroid and\nFigure 4 Expression of the erythroid and megakaryoblastic specific g enes in the murine erythroleukaemia cell line HB22.2 during\nhemin-induced differentiation .

Integration of\nF-MuLV upstream of Fli-1 is shown to block differen-\ntiation of this cell line [17]. However, these cells areable to undergo differentiation with hemin associatedinduction of alpha globin (Figure 4B). Among the 6 ery-throid genes tested, both Btbd14a and Ltbp2 showed\nreproducible changes with a decrease and an increasewith differentiation, resp ectively (Figure 4B). The\nincreased expression of Ltbp2 indicates that it likely\nplays a role in mature erythroid cells whereas Btbd14a\nis likely to play a role in imm ature erythroid cells and\nthis correlates well with a putative oncogenic role forthis gene.\nValidation in human leukaemic cell lines\nThe proteins encoded by these erythroid and megakaryo-blastic specific genes have high homologies with their\nhuman counterparts. This makes it likely that these\nhuman and murine proteins have the same functionalrole. Gene expression was first tested in 2 human ery-throid-like cell lines, HEL and K562, a human B-cell leu-kaemia cell line, TK6, and a human T-cell leukaemia cellline, Jurkat (Figure 5A). Because HEL and K562 areknown to harbour mixed myeloid lineage phenotype, thegenes were further tested in 2 human megakaryoblastic\ncell lines, MEG-01 and CMK, and 1 erythroid cell line\nLAMA-84 (Figure 5B).\nThe results show that all tested erythroid and mega-\nkaryoblastic specific genes were amplified in some or allof the cell lines confirming their expression in humanerythroid or megakaryoblasti c cell lines. Moreover, sev-\neral were also amplified in the lymphoid lines TK6 and/or in Jurkat. RABGEF1 and BTBD14A were the most\nubiquitous genes with a stro ng amplification in lym-\nphoid and non-lymphoid cell lines. GULP1 and SNCA\nwere the most specific to the non-lymphoid lineage withno expression in TK6 or Jurkat cell lines.\nViral integrations in the megakaryoblastic leukaemias\nWe also identified retroviral integration sites (RIS) in\nthe 3 megakaryoblastic leukaemias (Mk1-3) in order to\nsearch for genes that may have contributed to the\noncogenic transformation. Several RIS were amplified,cloned and sequenced in these 3 tumors (11 in Mk1, 5in Mk2 and 10 in Mk3) (Table 4). No common inte-gration sites (CIS) that could clearly indicate the con-tribution to the oncogenic events were found.Therefore, the results were compared to the retroviraltagged cancer gene database (RTCGD, [50]) thatcompiles the RIS identified in different murine cancer\nmodels (underlined in Table 4). Genes identified inmultiple screens have a high probability of involvement\nin oncogenic transformation. Eleven genes near the RISwere found in the RTCGD ( underlined in Table 4).\nSome of these genes, such as Ccnd1 and Myc, are lar-\ngely known to be involved in leukaemia. Foxf1 is a\ntranscription factor known to regulate the megakaryo-cytic integrin b3 (CD61) [51]. Interestingly, Kitand\nGata2 are also part of RIS. The presence of the RIS\nnear Kitin Mk1 and near Gata2 in Mk3 has been vali-\ndated by PCR in the sorted leukaemic megakaryoblas-tic population (not shown). Two other genes, Irf8 and\nItga1 targeted by a RIS (Table 4) are also of interest:\nIrf8 is not included in the RTCGD database but is a\nknown CIS [52] and the ITGA1 l o c u si sr e p r e s s e db y\nmethylation during megakaryopoiesis in humans [53].\nDiscussion\nCharacterization of genes specific to erythro- and\nmegakaryoblastic leukaemias\nPatient survey studies revealed that erythroleukaemias\nrepresent an average of 5% of all cases of acute myeloid\nleukaemias [3-5] and megakaryoblastic leukaemias havean incidence of approximately 1% in adults and 5-10%in children [6,7]. However, the overall survival rate isextremely poor and ranges from 6% to 17% [3,7]. Chil-dren suffering from Down Syndrome are an exceptionas they have a higher risk of developing megakaryoblas-tic leukaemias but respond better to therapy [54]. Acute\nerythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias are less stu-\ndied than the more frequent types of leukaemias. Thus,genes involved in the development of these leukaemiasremain insufficiently elucidated.\nOur experimental design is based on the comparison\nof non-lymphoid versus lymphoid murine leukaemiasand provides the whole pic ture of genes specific to\nthese 2 groups and subgroups. The sole comparison of\nthe non-lymphoid leukaemia s and their respective con-\ntrols without including the lymphoid group would nothave provided such a dataset. Therefore, numerousgenes not described previously or uncharacterizedemerged from this study. We estimated that, withint h ei d e n t i f i e dg e n es i g n a t u r e s ,t h e r ea r eo n c o g e n e sdirectly implicated in the disease and also genesrelated to the normal commitment of the cells toward\nthe erythro- or megakaryoblastic lineages. To deter-\nmine which genes are potential oncogenes, we firstcompared the erythroleukaemias to the erythroid con-trol samples and to the study of Welch and colleagues[40]. The comparison with the Welch ’s study enabled\nto assess the differentiation state of the leukaemias andthe control. Consequentl y, we could assume that the\ngenes under-expressed in c omparison to the controlVoisin et al.BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:2\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/2Page 11 of 17\nare late stage genes and that oncogenes are more likely\nto be within the over-expressed genes. We validatedthis hypothesis with Ltbp2 and Btbd14a in a differen-tiation assay in the HB22.2 erythroid cell line. Second,to gain more insights into the function of the megakar-yoblastic genes and in the absence of a control sample,\nwe compared our list of genes to the study of Shivda-\nsani and colleagues [37]. The comparison with the stu-dies of Welch for the erythroid leukaemias [40] and ofShivadasani [37] for the megakaryoblastic leukaemias\nprovides valuable information about the behaviour ofthe genes during normal differ entiation. However, their\nrespective microarray chips contained less probesetsthan ours and we could not perform the comparisonon the whole dataset. Therefore, further experiments\nare required to identify the unknown role played by\nthese genes in erythro- and megakaryoblasticleukaemias.\nFigure 5 Validation in human cell lines .

The left and right parts of each panel correspond to genes identified in the erythro- and megakaryoblastic\nleukaemias, respectively. GAPDH was used as internal control.Voisin et al.BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:2\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/2Page 12 of 17\nErythroid and megakaryoblastic genes\nErythroid and megakaryoblastic lineages, emerging from\nt h es a m eb i p o t e n tp r o g e n i t o r, are very closely related\n[11] and, as confirmed by our study, several transcrip-tion factors are commonly ex pressed. This strengthens\nthe hypothesis that a very fine tuning of these factorsinfluences the commitment toward the erythroid ormegakaryocytic lineages.\nOur microarray data indicate that Gata1 ,Gata2 ,Fog1 ,\nScland Lmo2 are expressed both in the Graffi-induced\nerythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias (Table 1).They are known to act on the promoter of their targetas multimeric complexes. Our study highlights that\nPU.1 (Sfpi1 ),Ctbp2 ,Cbfa2t3h (Eto2 ),Evi1 and Runx1\nhave a strong megakaryoblastic pattern. PU.1 is a known\ndeterminant of erythroid versus megakaryoblastic differ-\nentiation and the Gata2 protein acts on PU.1 [55]. The\nCbfa2t3h protein binds to the multimeric complexformed by Gata1, Fog1, Scl and Lmo2 and is known to\nrepress the transcription of the target genes. The co-repressor Ctbp2 is known to bind to Evi1 and Fog1 [56].Runx1 cooperates with Gat a1 during megakaryocytic\ncommitment [22,23] and the Runx1-Evi1 fusion proteinleads preferentially to the development of megakaryo-\nblastic leukaemias in transgenic mice [57]. In a model of\nin vitro differentiation, Evi1 is strongly induced and sus-\ntained upon thrombopoietin treatment of CD34\n+cells in\na pattern very similar to Gata2 and PU.1 but only\nweakly upon erythropoietin treatment [58]. Great evi-dence indicates that Evi1 is a direct activating target of\nGata2 [59]. Thus, our study reinforces the importanceof these genes in the megakaryoblastic leukaemias.\nRT-PCR validated megakaryoblastic genes\nThe specific megakaryoblastic expression of several geneswith poorly elucidated physiological roles was validated byTable 4 Graffi-virus integration sites in the megakaryoblastic leukaemias\nSample Chromosome Genome Upstream genes* Integra-tion\nwithin a geneDownstream genes*\ngene 1 kb gene 2 kb gene 1 kb gene 2 kb\nMk1 1D 93018002 Gm817 17 Lrrfip1 60 Ramp1 ** Ube2f 95 Scly 130\n1G2 153451217 Rnf2 188 1190005F20Rik 230 Niban Edem3 92 Q8K3Do 199\n4B1 41816941 2310028H24Rik 133 1700066J25Rik 138 Dnaic1 Cntfr 29 Dcnt3 86\n5E 1 75741720 Pdgfra 216 Gsh2 382 - Kit** 114 Kdr 472\n6F3 128801887 Klrb1b 10 Clec2h 159 - Clec21 50 Klrb1f 208\n6G1 135264443 Gsg1 61 Hebp1) 130 - Pbp2 10 Dynlt1 50\n11B4 70471623 Pfn1** 0.8 Rnf167 4 - Eno3 1.7 Spag7 8.2\n11B5 80139013 Rhot1 55 Rnf135 123 Rhbd13 Zfp207 60 Psmd11 105\n15D3 62283939 Pvt1 211 Myc** 463 --\n15F2 95582212 Dbx2 100 Nell2 225 -- Tmem16f 36\n16B3 33700976 Heg1 13 Slc12a8 118 - Muc13 12 Itgb5 ** 48\nMk2\n1 E4 132543823 Pfkb2 0.4 C4bp 54 - Yod1 0.8 AA986890 1\n6A3 25759728 Pot 1a 14 Grp37 120 -- -\n8 E1 123703449 Irf8 81 Cox4i1 149 - Foxf1a ** 269 Mthfsd 280\n12C1 52786246 Hectd1 120 EG544864 35 - Heatr5a 11 6530401NO4Rik 124\n13D2.3 116255725 Pelo 46 Itga1 33 -- -\nMk3\n1C5 Glrp1 146 Spp2 230 - Arl14c 161 Sh3bp4 413\n1F 139621937 -- Ptprc 257 Atp6v1g3 466\n2H3 165618991 Prkcbp1 ** 43 Eya2 156 - Ncoa3 65 Sulf2 146\n5B1 43941 Rheb 23 Cryng 83 - Prkag2 ** 20 1500035N22Rik 144\n6D2 88086902 Rpn1 16 EG434064 115 - Gata2 ** 72 Dnajb8 100\n7B4 45356428 Bax 21 Flt1 28 Dhdh Nucb1 4 Tulp2 25\n7F5 144856850 Ccnd1 ** 107 Oraov1 167 - Tpcn2) 167 Mrgprf 253\n13A1 3830652 Calm13 27 - Calm4 6 Calm5 22\n14C3 53491694 Prmt5 20 Rem2 57 - D14Ertd500e 4 Jub 31\n19A 4301566 Ankrd13d 18 Ssh3 32 Adrbk1 ** Fbxl13 15 FBXL13 15\n* the 2 most proximal genes located at a maximum distance of 500kb upstream (5 ’) or downstream (3 ’) of the integration site\n** genes present in the RTCGD databaseVoisin et al.BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:2\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/2Page 13 of 17\nRT-PCR. Our study repor ts for the first time Gucy1a3 ,\nGulp1 andFkbp9 as being specific to megakaryoblastic\nleukaemias. The function of these genes, related to thenormal development or transformation of megakaryocyticcells, has yet to be elucidated. Insight into their physiologi-cal roles can be provided by their already known functions\nin other cell types. Gucy1a3 is known to heterodimerize\nwith Gucy1b3 , which gene is also specific to the Graffi-\ninduced megakaryoblastic leukaemias. The Gucy1a3/b3\ncomplex produces cGMP after activation by nitric oxide(NO) itself produced by the NADPH oxidase from reactiveoxygen species. As expected, Ncf2 and other components\nof the NADPH oxidase ( Ncf1,Ncf4,Cybb ) are specifically\nover-expressed in the Graffi-induced megakaryoblastic\nleukaemias (Figure 2 and not shown). In human cancerous\nglioma cell lines, it is hypothesized that GUCY1a3/b3 may\nbe responsible for VEGF over-expression resulting in an\nincreased amount of NO [60]. NO is also known to play arole in platelet activation [61]. Gulp1 could be involved in\nthe intracellular vesicular trafficking [62] which is of highimportance in megakaryocytes for transporting the mole-cules in the storage organelles and during proplatelet for-\nmation. Fkbp9 is poorly studied and this present study\nreports its expression for the first time in cells of haemato-poietic origin. It is strongly expressed in our megakaryo-blastic leukaemias, in human non-lymphoid leukaemiasHEL, K562, CMK, Meg-01 and LAMA84, and to a lesserextent, in the murine erythroid leukaemias and cell line.\nRT-PCR validated erythroid genes\nThe selected erythroid genes with poorly elucidated phy-siological roles were Slamf1 ,Snca ,Ltbp2 ,Rabgef1 ,Cda\nandBtbd1a .Slamf1 is known to be expressed by activated\nlymphocytes but not yet identified in relation to erythroidleukaemias. The expression of Slamf1 in Friend virus-\ninduced erythroleukaemic c ell line HB22.2 confirms the\nGraffi model. The gene was recently revealed as a markerof haematopoietic stem cells distinguishing these cells\nfrom more differentiated progenitors [63]. Snca has\nalready been reported in eryt hrocytes [64,65]. Its over-\nexpression in the control sample and its increased expres-sion during erythroid differentiation (G1E dataset, Table3) indicate that it may be implicated in normal erythroidcells function. We did not observe a significant increaseduring HB22.2 induced differentiation. Ltbp2 is strongly\nexpressed in our erythroleukaemias and increases signifi-\ncantly during differentiation. It shows a non-lymphoid\nexpression pattern in the tested human cell lines and isidentified in relation to haematopoietic cells for the firsttime. Some studies suggest a role for Ltbp2 in cell adhe-\nsion and in cell migration [66]. Rabgef1 has never been\nreported in relation to erythroid lineage or leukaemiaand the encoded protein is known to interact withRab5, Rab21 or Rab22 [67]. Rab22a is indeed specificallyover-expressed in the 3 tested erythroleukaemias (not\nshown). RAB proteins are implicated in the intra-cellularvesicular traffic regulation and Rabgef1 is expressed in\nmast cells where it acts on Kit internalization [68]. Eventhough Rabgef1 expression pattern is more erythroid, it\nwas amplified in all other Graffi-induced leukaemias and\nin all the tested human cell lines, indicating its ubiquitous\nexpression in haematopoietic cells. Cda,r e s p o n s i b l ef o r\nresistance to chemotherapy treatment, is highly expressedin our erythroleukaemias, in HB22.2, K562 and HEL. TheGEO database shows that CDA is up-regulated during the\ndifferentiation of human CD34\n+cells toward the erythroid\nlineage (NCBI GEO, GSE4655). As of this day, Btbd14a\nhas never been studied. It is highly expressed in the Graffi-\ninduced erythroleukaemias and in HB22.2. Finally,\nBtbd14a appears ubiquitously expressed in the haemato-\npoietic system. The BTB/POZ domain of Btb14a is pre-\nsent in many oncogenes involved in the development ofleukaemia and is often found at the N-terminus of tran-scription factors. Thus, this gene is particularly interestingto further study as it shows a decreased expression duringHB22.2 induced differentiation and could represent a\npotential oncogene.\nThe MkMB Signature\nNumerous genes were commonly over-expressed in the\nmegakaryoblastic, the myeloid leukaemias and/or the B-cell leukaemias. These genes are, in most cases, alreadyknown to be expressed by cells implicated in innateimmunity. Platelets function is too often considered lim-\nited to blood coagulation and formation of thrombosis\nbut some studies now emphasize that the platelets ’role\nis underestimated in innate immunity and inflammationresponse [39,69-72]. Upon activation, platelets canrelease microbicidal proteins, interleukins that trigger ageneral inflammation response and chemokines thatrecruit immune cells such as leukocytes. Pathogens suchas bacteria and lentiviruses can be ingested by platelets\n[73]. The MkMB signature seems to reflect partly the\ncomplexity of the platelet function. Only very few exam-ples are shown in Table 2 but the complete list is avail-able in the supplementary data [19]. The unique designof this gene expression study that compared differenttypes of leukaemias highlights this signature.\nRetroviral integration and genes potentially implicated in\nthe onset of the disease\nThe analysis of retroviral integration enables the identi-\nfication of genes that may be responsible for malignanttransformation. In this study, we screened the 3 mega-karyoblastic leukaemias for viral integration sites as\noncogenic transformation events leading to megakaryo-blastic leukaemias remain unknown. No CIS were iden-tified but some genes in the RTCGD have drawn ourVoisin et al.BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:2\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/2Page 14 of 17\nattention due to their known functions. Within these\ngenes, Kitand Gata2 are of particular interest as accu-\nmulating evidences point at their role in megakaryopoi-esis and megakaryoblastic leukaemias.\nGata2 was recently reported for the first time as a com-\nmon integration site in leukaemias induced by the\nMOL4070LTR retrovirus in the NHD13 mouse [74]. In\nvitro studies showed that Gata2 over-expression redirects\nthe haematopoietic differentiation from the macrophagelineage toward the erythroid or the megakaryocyticlineages or from the erythroid toward the megakaryocyticlineage [55,75]. The importance of Gata2 on megakaryo-\npoiesis was also demonstrated in a differentiation study\nin which this gene is strongly induced and sustained\nupon thrombopoietin treatment of CD34\n+cells but only\nweakly induced upon erythropoietin treatment [58]. Theauthors made the interesting hypothesis that GATA2\nmight repress the expression of the erythroid markers inmaturing megakaryocytic cells since its activation inhibitserythroid differentiation in some systems.\nKitis involved in many cancers and is regulated by the\nSCL complex ( Gata1/2 ,SCL,Lmo2 ) in haematopoietic\ncells [76]. More evidence begins to emerge for its role\nin very early stages of megakaryopoiesis [77,78] and inmegakaryoblastic leukaemias [79,80]. Bourquin et al.\nreported increased levels of KIT,GATA2 and MYC in\nDS AMKL cells harbouring a GATA1 mutation com-\npared to non-DS AMKL cells. They hypothesized thatthe mutated GATA1 in DS AMKL cells failed to repress\nthe expression of these 3 genes [79].\nThe 3 megakaryoblastic leukaemias express very high\nlevels of KitandGata2 . We hypothesize that the viral inte-\ngrations may block the repression of these genes by con-tinuously activating the transcription or inhibiting thebinding of repressor molecules. KitandGata2 levels nor-\nmally decrease during megakaryocytic differentiation(Table 2 ‘GSE6593 ’). These 2 genes, affected by the retro-\nviral integration, would send continuous signals of prolif-\neration and survival to the cell. The analysis of a larger\nsample of Graffi-induced mega karyoblastic leukaemias\nwould be required to prove more efficiently the involve-ment of Gata 2a n d Kitin this particular type of leukaemia.\nConclusions\nIn this report, we compared the gene profiles of the ery-\nthro- and megakaryoblastic l eukaemias induced by the\nGraffi virus. Our study identifies genes that are highly\nexpressed in the Graffi-induced erythro- and megakar-yoblastic leukaemias. The complete dataset of this studyis readily available (GSE12581 and [19]). Within thedata, numerous genes have not yet been assigned with ak n o w nf u n c t i o na n ds o m eo ft h e mc o u l db eu s e da smarkers for specific types o f leukaemias and even the\ntarget of new therapies. We selected and RT-PCRvalidated genes those functions in normal cells are\npoorly characterized. For the majority, their expressionin these lineages is shown for the first time and furtherfunctional characterization will surely complement theknowledge of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.\nAdditional file 1: Oligonucleotides utilized in the RT-PCR\nexperiments . sequences of forward and reverse primers utilized in the\nRT-PCR experimentsClick here for file[ http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/supplementary/1755-8794-3-2-S1.DOC ]\nAdditional file 2: Immunophenotype of the leukaemic samples\nselected for the microarray experiments . the table lists the leukaemias\nincluded in the microarray experiments including sample name,\nleukaemia type, immunophenotype, antibody used for sorting and tumororigins.Click here for file[ http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/supplementary/1755-8794-3-2-S2.DOC ]\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank André Ponton, Michal Blazejczyk and Mathieu Miron from McGillUniversity and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montreal, Canada) for\ntheir help with the design and analyses of the microarray experiments.

Here, we describe the unique features of ALL-1 -associated leukaemias, and recent\nprogress in understanding molecular mechanisms involved in the activity of the ALL-1 protein and of its Drosophila homologueTRITHORAX.\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2004) 90,756–760. doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6601639 www.bjcancer.com\n&2004 Cancer Research UK\nKeywords: acute lymphoblastic and myelogeneous leukaemia; mouse models; chromatin; epigenetic marking/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12\nACUTE LEUKAEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL-1\nREARRANGEMENTS\nChromosome band 11q23 is involved in reciprocal chromosome\ntranslocations in 5– 10% of children and adults with acutelymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myelogeneous leukaemia(AML). Nearly all these rearrangements affect the ALL-1 gene, also\ntermed MLL1 ,HRX and HTRX , located at 11q23. The transloca-\ntions occur within an 8.3 kb breakpoint cluster region of the geneand result in the replacement of ALL-1 -coding sequence 3’ to the\nbreakpoint by the coding sequence of the translocation partner\n(Gu et al , 1992; Tkachuk et al , 1992). In a second and less frequent\ntype of rearrangement, ALL-1 undergoes partial tandem duplica-\ntion (self-fusion), resulting in the production of a larger protein\n(Schichman et al , 1995). The most common ALL-1 translocations\nare t(4; 11), t(9; 11), t(11; 19), t(6; 11) and t(10; 11), accounting for40, 27, 12, 5 and 5% of cases, respectively. However, the totalnumber of different loci participating in ALL-1 translocations is\namazingly high and has already exceeded 50 (Huret et al , 2001).\nThere is an association between particular chromosomal\ntranslocations involving ALL-1 and subtypes of leukaemias. Thus,\nt(4; 11) nearly always occurs in ALL, t(9; 11) is mostly associated\nwith AML, as are t(11; 19)(q23;p13.1), t(6;11), t(10;11) and thepartial duplications. t(11; 19)(q23;p13.3) occurs in both AML andALL. ALL1 -associated ALLs are characterised as CD10\n/C0, CD19þ\nand by B-cell precursor phenotype (pro B), with a high frequency\nof myeloid-associated (CD15 and/or CD65) antigen expression.Hence, they are also designated biphenotypic or mixed-lineageleukaemia. The AMLs are usually of the myelomonocytic (FAB-\nM4) or monoblastic (FAB-M5) morphological subtypes and\nsometimes express cell-surface lymphoid markers. The prognosisof patients with 11q23 abnormalities is dismal. Age is an important\nprognostic factor. Thus, less than 25% of infants ( o1 year) and\nadults older than 40 or 50 years, with t(4; 11) or t(9; 11), are cured.Patients of intermediate age, in particular 2– 9 or 1 –14 years old,\nhave significantly better prognosis (Johansson et al , 1998; Swans-\nbury et al , 1998; Pui et al , 2002).\nThe hallmark of ALL1 -associated leukaemias is their epidemiol-\nogy (reviewed in Greaves, 1999; Biondi et al , 2000). They\npredominate infant acute leukaemia (80% of ALL and 65% of\nAML), and account for the majority of therapy-related (secondary)leukaemias developing in 5–15% of primary cancer patients who\nhad received intensive chemotherapy, including epipodophyllo-\ntoxins (VP16) and anthracyclines (doxorubicin) (Pui and Relling,2000). These drugs are inhibitors of topoisomerase II, and act bystabilising double-strand DNA breaks generated by this enzyme. In\nboth infant and secondary leukaemias, the latency period is\nremarkably brief. In infants, ALL-1 rearrangements can be already\ndetected in utero and the average age at diagnosis is 6 months, and\nin secondary leukaemias, latency averages around 18– 30 months\n(reviewed in Greaves, 1999; Pui and Relling, 2000). The very brief\ntime between the initiating event and clinical disease, inconjunction with the high rate of concordance in identical twins\nwith infant leukaemia, points to the effectiveness of ALL-1 fusion\nproteins in driving the initial clone into frank leukaemia. Based onthe findings from therapy-related leukaemia, it was hypothesised(Ross et al , 1994) that transplacental exposure of the foetus to\nnatural substances that inhibit topoisomerase II (such as\nflavonoids in foods and drinks) might play a role in infantleukaemia. Such exposure will induce accumulation of DNA’sfree ends from within the breakpoint cluster region of ALL-1 ,\nand this would eventually result in 11q23 translocations. The\nresults of recent biochemical experiments (Strick et al , 2000)\nare consistent with this hypothesis. A structural feature sharedby many topoisomerase II inhibitors, including anticancer drugs,\nis the quinone moiety. The metabolism of quinones is controlled\nby the enzyme NQO1 that converts toxic benzoquinones to\nReceived 12 August 2003; revised 14 December 2003; accepted 15\nDecember 2003*Correspondence: E Canaani; E-mail: eli_canaani@weizmann.ac.il orA Mazo; E-mail: A_Mazo@lac.jci.tju.edu\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2004) 90, 756 – 760\n&2004 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved 0007 – 0920/04 $25.00\nwww.bjcancer.com\nhydroxyquinones. A polymorphism in nucleotide 609 of the\nenzyme substitutes a proline into serine and consequently\ninactivates the enzyme. Comparison of paediatric leukaemias with\nand without ALL-1 rearrangement indicated significant bias in theformer for NQO1 genotypes conferring low or no enzymaticactivity (Wiemels et al , 1999; Smith et al , 2002), suggesting that\ninactivating NQO1 polymorphism increases the risk for ALL-1-\nassociated leukaemias.\nMOUSE MODELS OF ALL-1 LEUKAEMOGENESIS\nTwo methodologies have been used to generate mouse models of\nALL-1 leukaemogenesis. Knockin of the partner gene AF9 into the\nALL-1 locus by homologous recombination resulted in animals\nthat developed AML at approximately 6 months (Dobson et al ,\n1999). Transmission of the transgene in the germ line and itsexpression during embryogenesis resulted in viable progeny. This,\ntogether with the observation that mice carrying a single null allele\nofALL-1 were not predisposed to AML (Corral et al , 1996), rules\nout a model of leukaemogenesis due to haploinsufficiency (passiveloss of function). Rather, an extensive series of investigations\napplying retro viral transduction into cultured haematopoietic\nprogenitor cells, followed by transplantation into mice, haveestablished that ALL-1 fusion genes act as dominant alleles and the\ndisease is due to ALL-1 gain of function. Structure –function\nanalysis of several ALL-1 fusion proteins showed that particular\nelements within the partner proteins, such as transcription effectordomains and protein–protein interaction motifs, are critical for\nthe leukaemogenic activity (reviewed in Ayton and Cleary, 2001).\nThe presence of dimerisation domains in some of the partnerproteins, such as AF6, AF10, AF17, AF1p, GAS7 and AF3p21suggested that self-association might underlie the role of the\npartner proteins with such motifs in the leukaemogenicity of ALL-\n1 fusion proteins. The most compelling experimental evidence forthis is that homodimerisation of ALL-1 by synthetic dimerisationmodules mimics many of the features of ALL-1 fusion proteins\n(Dobson et al , 2000; So et al , 2003b, Martin et al , 2003). Also,\ndisruption of the dimerisation motifs in some partner proteinseliminated pathogenicity. Although self-dimerisation appears to\nplay a key role in leukaemogenesis associated with partner\nproteins containing a dimerisation motif, the most commonfusions–ALL-1/AF4, ALL-1/AF9 and ALL-1/ENL –do not dimerise.\nBoth the knockin and retroviral transduction approaches turned\nout to be biased towards myeloid leukaemia. However, very recent\nstudies with virally transduced ALL1-ENL (Zeisig et al , 2003) and\nALL1-GAS7 (So et al , 2003a) showed transformation of bipheno-\ntypic lymphoid/myeloid cells and induction of biphenotypic\nleukaemia. So et al serially plated the transduced bone marrows\nin methylcellulose and found that the fusion protein conferredlong-term growth capacity to multipotential progenitors. The\nprogenitors spontaneously differentiated into biphenotypic and\nmyeloid progenitors during culturing in vitro . Moreover, mice\ninjected with the transduced serially-plated progenitors developedeither biphenotypic leukaemia, or AML or ALL. On the basis of\nthese experiments, it was proposed that ALL-1 fusion proteins\nenhance the self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors thatretain an ability to differentiate into downstream progeny. Thelatter are more susceptible to differentiation blocking by ALL-1\nfusion proteins, or are prone to secondary mutations required for\nfull malignant transformation.\nGENE EXPRESSION PROFILES OF ALL-1 LEUKAEMIAS\nDNA microarrays technology has been recently applied to\nconstruct expression profiles of ALLs and/or AMLs with ALL-1\nrearrangements (Rozovskaia et al , 2001, 2003; Armstrong et al ,\n2002; Yeoh et al , 2002). Both ALL-1 -associated ALLs and AMLshave distinct expression patterns that distinguish them from other\ntypes of ALL and AML, respectively. The distinction is more robust\nfor ALL, probably reflecting the unusual clinical and biological\nfeatures and the biphenotypic trait of the disease, not sharedby other classes of ALL. In one study (Rozovskaia et al , 2003),\ngenes whose expression pattern separated ALLs with t(4;11) from\nother ALLs were further subdivided, enabling the identification of\ntwo subfamilies of t(4;11) tumours. In that study, a substantialnumber of the genes, which were found to correlate in theirexpression with the t(4;11) genotype, had been previously\nassociated with cancer, apoptosis or growth control. These\nincluded overexpressed oncogenes (such as HOX A9 ,HOX A10 ,\nMEIS1 ,LMO2 and MYC ), overexpressed genes involved in\nprotection from apoptosis and in survival, underexpressed\nproapoptotic genes, overexpressed genes involved in drug\nresistance and underexpressed tumour suppressors and growthinhibitors such as FHIT and DAPK1 .\nDetermination of which of the genes pointed out in the DNA\nmicroarrays analyses plays a direct role in pathogenesis mightcome from experiments with mice. One approach will be to alterthe expression (e.g. by interference RNA) of a suspected gene in\ncell lines with 11q23 translocations, and examine whether the\ncapacity of the cell lines to induce leukaemia in mice is lost. Thesecond approach will be to transduce the fusion genes into micenull for genes suspected of playing an essential role in ALL-1\npathogenesis, and examine the effect on leukaemia development.\nSuch an experiment has been recently reported for HOX A9 and\nHOX A7 (Ayton and Cleary, 2003). These two genes were found\nrequired for in vitro myeloid immortalisation by the MLL/ENL\nfusion protein transduced by a retroviral vector into bone marrowcells. Further, HOX A9 was found to be indispensable for ALL-1-\ndependent leukaemogenesis in vivo . Applying a complementary\napproach, Kumar et al (2004) bred mice to obtain animals\ntransgenic for MLL-AF9 and null for HOX A9 and examined\nleukaemia development. Surprisingly, the absence of HOX A9 did\nnot affect the incidence and latency of leukaemia, although the\nmalignant cells displayed a more immature myeloid phenotype.\nThe authors suggest that several HOX genes might have to be\ninactivated to impair leukaemogenicity. The reasons for thecontrasting conclusion obtained by the two approaches are\ncurrently not known.\nBIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY OF\nALL-1 AND ITS DROSOPHILA HOMOLOGUE\nTRITHORAX (TRX)\nALL-1 and TRX are members of the evolutionary conserved gene\nfamily termed as the Trx group (TrxG) that are positive regulatorsof the homeotic gene complex ( HOX ) during development, and\nwhose activity is opposed by the repressive activity of the\nPolycomb group (PcG). The TrxG and PcG proteins are not\nrequired for initiation of HOX genes activity, but act to maintain\ntranscriptional states through later stages of development (re-\nviewed in Brock and van Lohuizen, 2001; Simon and Tamkun,\n2002). ALL-1 also acts at the stage of maintenance (Yu et al , 1998).\nSince considerably more genetic and biological information isavailable about TRX , in comparison to ALL-1 , here we will\nemphasise studies of the former. Approximately 20 genes have\nbeen characterised as members of the fly TrxG; however, thisnumber is rapidly growing based on genetic and molecular criteria(Gildea et al , 2000; Faucheux et al , 2003). Further, it has became\napparent that the target genes of the TrxG are not limited to HOX\ngenes (Kuzin et al , 1994; Maurange and Paro, 2002; Beltran et al ,\n2003). In this context, we have recently demonstrated (Smith et al ,\n2004) that following heat induction, the TRX complex is quickly\nrecruited to several heat-shock genes on salivary polytenechromosomes, where it is required to maintain a high level of\nALL-1/MLL1 and acute leukaemia\nE Canaani et al\n757\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2004) 90(4), 756 – 760 &2004 Cancer Research UK\nalready initiated transcription. Such a role is similar to the role of\nTRX in HOX gene expression.\nMuch effort was devoted to in vivo analysis of the properties of\nTrxG and PcG response elements (TRE and PRE, respectively) attarget loci in Drosophila. The emerging picture of the best studiedtarget, the regulatory region of the Drosophila Bithorax complex\nBX-C gene Ubx, suggests that although TREs and PREs are\nintermingled within a 1.5 kb region bxd, they may represent\nseparable regulatory elements (Tillib et al , 1999). It is still not clear\nwhether the TrxG and PcG proteins occupy their respective\nresponsive elements at all time, or only when the target gene is\nactive or repressed, respectively. Evidence that these proteins mayoccupy their binding sites depending on the status of geneexpression came recently from analysis of Drosophila larval fat\nbody (Marchetti et al , 2003). BX-C genes are repressed in the\nanterior region of the fat body, but are active in the mid-posteriorpart. In parallel, the PC protein (but not TRX) was detected at the\ncytological site of bithorax on polytene chromosomes from\nthe anterior part of the fat body, while a strong signal ofTRX (but not of PC) was detected on chromosomes from themid-posterior fat body.\nThe mechanism by which TRX and ALL-1 reach their target loci\nis not known. The absence of sequence-specific DNA-bindingprotein among components of the TRX and ALL-1 complexes (seelater) emphasises this quandary. Several recent studies (Bender\nand Fitzgerald, 2002; Hogga and Karch, 2002; Rank et al , 2002)\nshowed that ectopic or induced transcription through regulatoryelements of the Bithorax complex switches the elements from\nsilenced to activated states. On the basis of this, it was proposed\nthat passage of the RNA polymerase II complex through aregulatory element displaces the repressive PcG complex, set thereby default, and enables recruitment of the TRX complex that\nimprints epigenetic marks instructing transcription of the adjacent\nHOX gene.\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments previously\nidentified TRX both on TREs and on promoters within the\nBithorax gene complex (Orlando et al , 1998). The ChIP\nmethodology was recently applied to ALL-1 (Nakamura et al ,\n2002; Milne et al , 2002) and the protein was found bound at the\npromoters of HOX A9 and HOX C8 in cultured cells expressing\nthese genes (homologues of Drosophila TREs and PREs have not\nbeen identified yet in mammals). Elimination of ALL-1, byapplying interference RNA methodology, blocked transcription\nofHOX A9 . Both studies showed that ALL-1 is a histone\nmethyltransferase that methylates lysine 4 of histone H3. Theenzymatic activity is conferred by the C-terminal SET domain. Thepresence of ALL-1 on the promoters of the two HOX genes is\nlinked to H3-Lys4 methylation as well as to acetylation of histones\nH3 and H4 at the promoter. Several other TrxG, PcG, and otherchromatin – associated proteins containing SET domains – wererecently shown to methylate histones at specific residues (reviewed\nin Orlando, 2003). Such marking of histones (as are acetylation,\nphosphorylation and ubiquitination of specific histone residues)conveys heritable transcription patterns (expression or silencing)\nin an epigenetic manner.\nThe molecular mechanisms by which TRX and ALL-1 act was\nfurther elucidated by the identification and characterisation ofstable protein complexes associated with the two proteins. TRX is a\ncomponent of the TAC1 complex that includes the histone\nacetyltransferase (HAT) dCBP, and a SET - binding factor, SBF1(Petruk et al , 2001). The recruitment of TAC1 components to the\nHSP70 locus following heat induction results in enhanced\nexpression of the gene and correlates with acetylation and\nmethylation of histones (Smith et al , 2004). The ALL-1 complex\n(Nakamura et al , 2002) completely varies from that of TRX. It\ncontains at least 29 proteins. The majority of the latter are\ncomponents of seven subcomplexes involved in transcriptionpreinitiation, nucleosome remodelling, histone deacetylation,histone methylation or RNA processing. The purified ALL-1\ncomplex methylates, acetylates, deacetylates and remodels nucleo-\nsomes and is bound at the promoter of the target gene HOX A9 .I t\nappears that a major role of ALL-1 is to assemble this largesupercomplex of enzymatic activities. In summary, the recentbiochemical experiments indicate that TRX and ALL-1 recruit to\ntarget genes a host of enzymatic activities, mostly involved in\nepigenetic marking. The way in which these marks are inherited toprogeny cells (memorized) is not known (they have to surviveDNA replication, during which the histones are thought to be\nstripped off the DNA), but it has been speculated (Turner, 2000;\nRichards and Elgin, 2002) that the modified histones stay at ornear the replication fork and are incorporated into the daughterDNA strands.\nUNRESOLVED ISSUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nWhile considerable progress was made in identification of thebiochemical activities of the ALL-1 and TRX protein complexes,the mechanism by which these complexes are recruited to specific\nsequences (genes) is completely unknown. The recent reports that\ntranscription of regulatory regions induces heritable transcrip-tional activation of the Drosophila BX-C genes raises the\npossibility that such a mechanism is involved in the recruitment\nof TRX and ALL-1 complexes. Another outstanding issue is the\nidentification of genes, other than HOX , that are regulated by ALL-\n1 and TRX. The demonstration that the mammalian PcG protein\nBMI-1 regulates the important cell cycle locus INK4a/ARF (Jacobs\net al , 1999) suggests that looking for additional ALL-1/TRX targets\n(e.g. by conditional elimination or activation of the two proteins,followed by DNA microarray analysis) might be rewarding.\nFurther, the process by which the ALL-1-mediated histone H3-\nLys4 methylation induces chromatin alteration (presumablydecondensation) and gene expression, and the precise roles ofthe transcriptional subcomplexes within ALL-1 supercomplex,\nhave yet to be determined. A new line of investigation is likely to\noriginate from the recent remarkable finding that the PHD fingermotif of the ING2 protein binds phosphoinositides, and that thisinteraction regulates the biological activity of the latter (Gozani\net al , 2003). The presence of four PHD finger motifs in both ALL-1\nand TRX points to a potential central mechanism by which theseproteins are regulated. Finally, the reason why ALL-1 (and\npresumably TRX) is proteolytically cleaved by an evolutionary\nconserved enzyme into two polypeptides, which are held together,is not known (Nakamura et al , 2002; Yokoyama et al , 2002; Hsieh\net al , 2003).\nMouse models have recently identified the type of precursor cell\ntransformed by ALL-1 fusion proteins, and DNA microarraysanalyses focused attention on genes that might play a direct role inleukaemogenesis. Identification of such genes is clearly a focal\npoint for understanding the disease in molecular terms and for\nfuture therapeutic intervention. However, other central questionsremain. First, do all ALL-1 fusions, including self-fusions, trigger a\nsingle pathway leading to disease? Why are most fusions associated\nwith specific leukaemia subtype (e.g. ALL1-AF4 with ALL, ALL1-AF6 with AML)? Second, since the fusion proteins lack the SETdomain with its histone H3-Lys4 methylation activity, how do they\nretain transcriptional activation capacity? Do they target all genes\nregulated by normal ALL-1? Do they compete with normal ALL-1on the same targets? Do they block transcription of some loci?Also, the absence of the PHD fingers in ALL-1 fusion proteins\nshould relieve them from potential regulation by phosphoinosi-\ntides; whether this is an important aspect of the leukaemogenicactivity of these proteins has yet to be determined. A third issue is\nwhether ALL-1 fusions confer resistance to apoptosis. ALL-1-\nassociated leukaemias are notorious for their poor prognosis withchemotherapy, and exhibit drug resistance. Since it is now believed\nALL-1/MLL1 and acute leukaemia\nE Canaani et al\n758\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2004) 90(4), 756 – 760 &2004 Cancer Research UK\nthat the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic drugs is through\nactivation of apoptotic pathways, drug resistance of ALL-1 leukaemias\nmight be due to disruption of apoptotic processes. Such disruptions\nappear to be crucial for the development of many tumours (reviewedin Johnstone et al , 2002). Still, very little has been reported about this\nissue with regard to ALL-1 leukaemias. In one study (Kersey et al ,\n1998), ALLs with t(4; 11) were compared to similar tumours without\nt(4; 11) and found to be dramatically more resistant to serumdeprivation stress. A recent investigation (Wiederschain et al , 2003)\nshowed nuclear colocalisation of the fusion protein ALL1-ELL withp53, and loss of p53-mediated apoptosis. Whether this phenomenon\nis unique to that particular fusion protein or is it of a more general\nnature is presently not known.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe apologise to our colleagues whose work was not cited, due to\nspace limitations.

Thusthe\ncombined leukaemia resultssuggest thattheincidence of\nALLinyoungchildrenbegantoincreaseclearlyin1963-67.\nTherisksofchildhood leukaemia fromionising radiation\nexposure havebeenestablished (Doll,1989).InNewZealand,\nwehavenonuclearpowerstations orreprocessing plants.A\nstudyofchildhood leukaemia incidence ratesinNordic\ncountries inrelation tofalloutfromnuclearweapons testing\nfoundnostrongoverallchildhood leukaemia trends(Darby\netal.,1992).However, theratesofchildhood leukaemia were\nslightlyhigherinthelate1960s,whentheeffectwouldhave\nbeengreatest (Darby etal.,1992).Fallout fromnuclear\nweapons testinghasbeenmonitored inNewZealand bythe\nNational Radiation Laboratory, and'concentrations of\nstrontium-90 andcaesium-137 incows'milkpeakedin1965\n.....andhaddecreased tothelimitsofdetection by1986',\n(Matthews, 1994).Initially(afterthe1965peak),theaverage\nhalf-life ofeachradionuclide waslessthan2years\n(Matthews, 1994).Iffallouthadamaterial effecton\nleukaemia inyoungchildren inNewZealand, itwouldbe\nexpected tohaveledtoapeakinincidence soonafter1965,\nfollowed byadecline. Thus,thecontinued increase inthe\nincidence ofchildhood leukaemia inNewZealand doesnot\nappear toberelated tofallout.\nSeveral case-control studies(and onecohortstudy)of\nchildhood leukaemia andelectromagnetic field exposures\nhavebeenreported. While somehaveshown increased\nrisks,othershavenot,andnofirmconclusions canyetbe\ndrawn(Advisory Group onNon-ionising Radiation, 1992;\nRossetal.,1994).Detailed data ondomestic electricity\nconsumption, supplied byTranspower NewZealand, showed\naremarkably consistent andcontinued increase inaverage\nannualconsumption from2.5megawatt hours(MWh) per\nhousehold in1946to8.1MWhin1976.Domestic\nconsumption thenreached aplateau, remaining between 7.1\nand7.9MWh perhousehold from1977to1993.The\nincidence ofchildhood ALLhasfollowed adifferent course,\nsoitisunlikely thattheleukaemia increases arerelated to\nhousehold consumption ofelectricity (acrude measure of\nexposure toelectromagnetic fields).\nInacase-control study,Golding etal.(1990)reported\nthatbabiesgivendrugs(mainly vitamin K)intheneonatal\nperiodhadanincreased riskofchildhood cancer.Golding et\nal.(1992)testedtheassociation inasecondstudy,finding a\ndoubling oftheriskofchildhood cancer inrelation to\nintramuscular vitamin Kadministration, butnoelevation in\nriskfororaladministration. Threefurtherstudiesofthisissue\nhavenotfoundelevated risksofchildhood leukaemia\nfollowing vitamin Kadministration, including acohort\nstudyfromSweden (Ekelund etal.,1993), anested case-\ncontrolstudyfromtheUSA(Klebanoff etal.,1993)anda\ndescriptive study(ofbirthcohorts) fromDenmark (Olsen et\nal.,1994).According totheDepartment ofHealth,\nintramuscular vitamin Khadbeenavailable forusein\nneonates inNewZealand sincethelate1960s.(KRonaldson,\npersonal communication). Butvitamin Kwasgiven\nroutinely atNational Women's Hospital, with5000\ndeliveries peryearasearly as1962(RHowie, personal\ncommunication). Thus, someoftheNewZealand timetrends\nareconsistent withthevitamin Khypothesis. TheBritish\ntimetrendsforchildhood leukaemia inrelation totrendsin\nintramuscular vitamin Kadministration, ontheotherhand,\nareprobably notconsistent withthishypothesis (Draper and\nStiller,1992).\nChildhood ALLhasbeenassociated withadvanced\nmaternal ageinsome,butnotall,studies(Ross etal.,\n1994).Themedian ageatwhich women hadtheirfirstchild\ninNewZealand increased by5.7yearsbetween 1962and\n1993,compared withariseofonly2.1yearsforallmothers\n(rather thannewmothers) between these years(Statistics\nNewZealand, 1995).However, thesefiguresconceal thefact\nthatforallmothers there wasaslightdropinthemedian\nmaternal ageatdelivery between 1962and1972,atwhich\npointtheincrease beganandcontinued until1993(Statistics\nNewZealand, 1995).Thus,thelaterchildhood leukaemia\ntrends(aftertheearly1970s),butnottheearliertrendsmight\nbeconsistent withincreasing maternal age.However, an\neffectofmaternal ageonchildhood ALLriskshasnotbeen\nobserved consistently inanalytical studies, andtheoverall\nchange intheageofNewZealand mothers hasnotbeen\nlarge.Changes inmaternal agedonotseemtooffer a\nsufficient explanation fortheincrease intheincidence of\nchildhood ALLobserved inthisstudy.\nSeveralstudies(butnotall)havereported ahigherriskof\nchildhood leukaemia forfirstborn children (Rossetal.,1994).\nTheproportion offirstborn children inthepopulation is\nlikelytohaveincreased asfamilysizeshavedecreased.\nFamilysizeinNewZealand increased inthepostwaryears;\nthere wasapeakinthetotalfertility ratein1961,thena\ndeclineuntil1983,followed byasmallincrease (Department\nofStatistics, 1993b). Between 1976and1991,theaverage size\noftheNewZealand household declined from3.2to2.8\nmembers (PublicHealthCommission ofNewZealand, 1993).\nThus,ifthereisarealassociation between birthorderandChildhoodleukaemias inNewZealand\nJDDockerty etal x\n1145\nchildhood leukaemia, onemightexpecttohaveseenan\nincrease inincidence ratesbeginning afterthe1961peakin\nthefertilityrate.Theresultsofthisstudyhavesuggested that\ntheincidence ofchildhood leukaemia probably beganto\nincrease inabout1963-67.

Theexplanation may\nbethatinthes.c.regionthereisless\nmuscular tissueavailable forthereplica-\ntionoftheviruswithspecialtropism for\nthistissue.Theeffectiveness oftheexperi-\nmentalprotocol usingMSV-M asalive\nvaccine forimmunoprevention studies\nwasconfirmed inthefirstgroupofexperi-\nmentsinwhichimmunized micewere\nchallenged withFLV,RLV7andMLV,also\nusedinotherlaboratories forimmuno-\nprevention assays.Extension oftheex-\nperiments tootherleukaemia viruses\noriginating inourlaboratory showed\neffective protection againstprimary leuk-\naemiasinduced byPLLVandHI79A/LV.\nHowever, although serological data(Fefer,\n1967)andinimmunization withMSV-G\n(Basombrio etal.,1977)haveindicated the\npresence ofcross-reacting antigens inGLV'\nandMSV-M, nosignificant protection\nagainst GLVcouldbedetected.\nTransplantable cellular leukaemias,negative tosensitive invivovirusonco-\ngenicity assays, werealsotested.Itwas\nobserved thattheevolution ofH110\nleukaemia, andtoalesserdegreeR14\nleukaemia, couldberetarded. However,P277, anextremely fast-growing and\nlethalleukaemia, couldnotbeprevented,\ninspiteofbeingoriginally inducedbyMoloney virus.\nThestudies ontheeffectofMSV-M\nimmunity onspontaneous leukaemo-\ngenesisinBALB/c and(SwissxAKR)F1\nhybrids werecomplicated bydifficulties\nrelated tolong-term observations. In\nBALB/c mice,whichhadreceived 3\nMSV-M injections, mortality wasin-\ncreased: MSV-M wasshowntoexistin\nleukaemic spleens ofthesemice,since\nacellular s.c.passage ledtolocalgrowth\nofsarcoma. Thisincreased mortality was\nnotfoundinthe(SwissxAKR)F1\nhybrids, probably becauseonlyoneMSV-\nMimmunizing dosewasused;leukaemia\nincidence wassimilarinbothexperimental\nandcontrol groups, MSV-M-immunized\nmiceshowing significantly earlierspon-\ntaneousleukaemia upto13monthsofage.\nLong-term observation ofMSV-M-\nimmunized micechallenged withleuk-\naemiaviruses, transplantable leukaemias\norcontrolled fortheincidence ofspon-\ntaneous leukaemias, revealed increased\nmortality. Howcanthisbeexplained? In\nthefirstplace,invivointeraction between\ninfectious FLV,MLV,RLVandMSV-M\ncouldincrease theoncogenicity ofMSV-M\n(Chirigos etal.,1968;Turner&Chirigos,1969).Newphenotypic mixtures might\nassemble between theinoculated leuk-\naemiavirusandtheMSV-M usedfor\nimmunization (Chieco-Bianchi etal.,1975).\nIncertain mousestrains,notably C58and\nAKR,theMSV-M formsphenotypic mix-\ntureswiththeendogenous GLV,pro-\nducingnewpseudotypes thatcouldinduce\nsarcomas oflethalandprogressive growth\n(Chieco-Bianchi etal.,1974).Thuspheno-\ntypicmixing couldprovide newgenetic\ninformation which would modify the\nbiology andpathogenicity oftheoriginal\npseudotype usedasimmunogen. Secondly,973\n974 A.M.S.MAYER, M.A.BASOMBRIO ANDC.D.PASQUALINI\nithasbeenobserved thatafterregression\nofMSV-M-induced sarcomas thevirus\nremains inthelymphoid tissuesofthe\nmouseasapersistent infection controlled\nbythehost(Chieco-Bianchi &Collavo,\n1976;Giuliani etal.,1973).Ontheother\nhand,6-month-old miceshowagaina\ngreatsensitivity toMSV-M oncogenesis\n(Pazmifio &Yuhas, 1973).Thusrenewed\nMSV-M sarcomagenesis mightcauseun-\nexpected mortality inlong-term experi-\nmentsduetoreactivation ofthevirus.\nThirdly, thegenotype ofmicehasagreat\nbearing ontheresultofMSV-M onco-\ngenesis: BALB/c miceareknowntobe\nverysusceptible, whilst(SwissxAKR)F1\nhybrids areveryresistant (Colombatti et\nal.,1975)whichcouldaccount forthe\nobserved difference inmortality.\nCouldinactivation oftheimmunizing\nMSV-M virusoverride thesedifficulties?\nProbably not,sincerecentobservations\nhaveshownthattheproteinfraction gp7l\nfromFLVinoculated inC57andAKR\nmiceproduces viralactivation (Ihleetal.,\n1976a).Thiswouldsuggest amechanism\nmediated byviralcomponents, aneffect\ncapableofcomplicating anystudyonthe\nviralimmunoprevention ofmurinie leuk-\naemia.Theblocking ofviralreplication\nwouldnotbeasufficient guarantee to\nhindertheactivation ofendogenous virus\nwhichwouldleadtoleukaemic transforma-\ntioninmicesubjected tolongobservation.\nRecapitulating, ourprotocol, usinga\nliveMSV-M vaccine, provedsuccessful in\nshort-term experiments, protecting against\ntheinduction ofprimary leukaemias and\npartially against transplantable leuk-\naemias. Itwasnotpossible, however, to\nobtainprotection against spontaneous\nleukaemias.\nREFERENCES\nAXELRAD, A.A.(1963)Changes inresistance tothe\nproliferation ofisotransplanted Gross virus-\ninduced lymphoma cells,asmeasured witha\nspleencolonyassay.Nature, 199,80.\nBARsKI, G.&YOUN, J.K.(1965)Immunization\nagainst Rauscher Mouse Leukemia withtissue\nculturematerial.

Introduction\nRearrangements of the mixed lineage leukaemia gene ( MLLr ) are the most common cytogenetic\nabnormalities found in infant and childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid\nleukaemia (AML) [ 1] and are found in 80% and 35–50% of all paediatric ALL and AML cases\nrespectively [ 1]. These leukaemias do not typically acquire many secondary mutations [ 2] and are\nthought to result from inappropriate repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) via nonhomologous\nend joining (NHEJ) in haematopoietic cells [ 3]. As the 8.3-kb breakpoint cluster region of mixed\nlineage leukaemia ( MLL ) is located between exons 8 and 13 for almost all MLLr cases [ 4], these fusion\ngenes contain the ﬁrst 8–13 exons of MLL and a variable number of exons from the fusion partner\ngenes (FPGs). Up to 135 MLL FPGs have been identiﬁed and are well described elsewhere [ 5–7].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266; doi:10.3390 /ijms21124266 www.mdpi.com /journal /ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 2 of 15\nThese include cytoplasmic proteins (AF6, GAS7 and EEN), septins (SEPT2, SEPT5, SEPT6, SEPT9\nand SEPT11) and histone acetyltransferases (CBP and P300) as well as the largest subset, the nuclear\nproteins. This category contains the most common FPGs such as ENL ,ELL,AF4,AF9 and AF10 ,\nwhich account for approximately 80% of all MLL fusions [ 5]. Of these, MLL-AF9 (MA9) t(9;11)(p22;q23)\ntranslocations are found in 30% of MLLr AML cases [ 5] irrespective of age and are commonly found in\na subset of adult patients with therapy-related AML [8].\nAlthough the precise functional properties of AF9 are unknown, it has been demonstrated to\nform multimer complexes with members of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) complex\nand disruptor of telomere silencing ( DOT1L ) via a conserved ANC1 homology domain (AHD),\nindicating a role in transcriptional regulation [ 9,10]. These properties appear to play a critical role in\nleukaemic transformation [ 11,12]. Oncogenic properties of MLL fusion proteins include interference\nwith transcriptional elongation, resulting in dysregulation of target genes [ 13,14]. Aberrant expression\nof MLL target genes is strongly dependent on DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation [ 15], which is\na critical requirement for MA9 leukaemogensis [ 16]. Members of the Homeobox ( HOX ) family are\ncommonly overexpressed in MLLr leukaemias as a direct target of MLL fusion proteins [ 4,17]. The HOX\nfamily are critical factors in the self-renewing properties of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their\noverexpression results in a di \u000berentiation block and an increase in self-renewal of immature myeloid\nprogenitor cells. The HOX cofactors MEIS1 [18,19] and PBX3 [20] are also direct targets of MLL fusion\nproteins [ 21] frequently found upregulated in coordination with HOX targets. Importantly, there is\nevidence to suggest that MA9-mediated leukaemia can progress even in the absence of HOX genes\nsuch as HOXA9 [22], indicating an important role of non- HOX family genes. This includes CDK6 [23],\nEVI-1 [24,25] and EYA1 [26,27], which are also found upregulated in MLLr leukaemias as a result of\ndirect binding of MLL-FPG proteins to gene promoters [ 26,28,29], and play a vital role in leukaemic\ntransformation including cellular immortalization [ 26], hyperproliferation [ 23,24], chemoresistance [ 24]\nand dysregulated self-renewal [ 25,27]. CDK6 speciﬁcally has been highlighted as a critical e \u000bector of\nMLLr leukemogenesis as its depletion in mice with MA9-driven AML was shown to overcome the\nmyeloid di \u000berentiation block and to prolong survival in vivo [29].\nNumerous murine models of MLLr have been generated and have each o \u000bered valuable insights.\nLimitations with murine models are in large part due to the technology used to mimic MLL chromosomal\nrearrangements. An early knock-in model [ 30] utilized homologous recombination (HR) to generate\nanMll-Af9 fusion gene and displayed a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), leading primarily to AML\ncharacterized by expansion of immature myeloid populations with a small percentage developing\nB-cell ALL (B-ALL) [ 31]; thus, this model resembles the phenotypic heterogeneity of MLLr leukaemias,\nwhich can manifest as AML; ALL; or in a minority of cases, mixed phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL).\nHowever, this system lacked tissue-speciﬁc control of MA9 expression throughout development and\nmice were prone to developmental defects as a result of heterozygosity for wild type (WT) Mll[32].\nTo gain more insight into cell-type speciﬁc e \u000bects, a subsequent approach involved enrichment of\nhaematopoietic populations from these HR-generated MA9 knock-in mice, followed by secondary\ntransplantation into WT recipients [ 33]. This also demonstrated e \u000ecient generation of AML, especially\nwhen Lin\u0000Sca-1 +c-Kit+(LSK) cells, which include HSCs and haematopoietic stem and progenitor\n(HSPCs), were transplanted. An advantage of these methods is the expression of the MA9 transgene from\nthe endogenous Mllpromoter, which results in physiological transgene expression levels. This model\ncannot however address the leukaemia stem cell origin with respect to de novo AML initiation.\nTranslocator models utilizing the Cre-loxP system have generated MA9 translocations via loxP\nsites inserted into those intronic regions of endogenous Mlland Af9genes where breakpoints are\nmost frequently found in human MLLr patients [ 34]. Using Lmo2-Cre to express Cre recombinase,\nMll-Af9 was generated in pluripotent stem cells and led exclusively to myeloid leukaemia whereas\nT-cell-restricted expression using lck-Cre did not lead to leukomogeneis [ 35]. The advantage of\nthis Cre-loxP system is that MA9 expression can be driven by lineage-restricted promoters from\nthe endogenous loci [ 35], reﬂecting physiological expression. Further models targeting Mll-Af9\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 3 of 15\nexpression to speciﬁc cells within the haematopoietic system have utilized retrovirus-driven expression\nfollowed by transduction and transplantation approaches. These methods beneﬁt from its speed\nand ease of use [ 36,37] and has led to the identiﬁcation of both the HSC and the granulocyte and\nmacrophage progenitor (GMP) as potential leukaemic stem cells-of-origin with divergent clinical\nfeatures [ 38]. Retrovirus-mediated expression models however drive transgene expressions that\nare not physiological. To gain greater control over the level of cell-restricted transgene expression,\nDox-inducible transgenic models have since been developed [ 39,40] enabling close-to-physiological\nlevels and reversible transgene expression in a Dox dose-dependent manner. Using this model, it was\ndemonstrated that long-term HSC (LT-HSC) populations result in an invasive and chemoresistant AML\nwith a primitive progenitor phenotype and a distinct stemness-related gene expression pattern [ 39].\nDox-inducible transgene expression is however not controlled by an endogenous promoter. “Leaky” Cre\nexpression from tissue-speciﬁc promoters together with the expensive and time-consuming nature of\ntissue-restricted strain generation are major limitations with the Cre-loxP and Dox-inducible transgenic\nmodel systems. More recent attempts to circumvent some of the issues highlighted above have utilized\ntranscription activator like e \u000bector nucleases (TALEN) technology to generate endogenous MA9 [ 41,42].\nThese cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher clonogenic potential with colony morphologies consistent\nwith an immature cell type and development of AML, ALL and MPAL upon xenotransplantation [ 41].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /Cas9 technology facilitates\ncreation of DSBs at almost any genomic sequence of interest technology and has revolutionised the\nway in which we are able to manipulate the genome, a \u000bording a more ﬂexible and readily applicable\nmethod for generating novel disease models, including chromosomal translocations, with an ease and\nsimplicity far outweighing prior technologies such as TALEN and Cre-LoxP . CRISPR technology has\nfacilitated generation of chromosomal deletions [ 43] and rearrangements, including inversions [ 44] and\ntranslocations [ 45–48]. Here, we demonstrate e \u000ecient CRISPR-mediated generation of an endogenous\nMll-Af9 reciprocal translocation in a murine cell line and primary HSPCs. By utilizing a dual-single\nguide RNA (sgRNA) approach to target the most common breakpoints in human MA9 rearrangements,\nwe show rapid, reliable generation of simultaneous breakpoints and a fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels. The resultant transformed cells reliably recapitulated features of human MLLr\nleukaemias. These include increased expression of MA9 target genes, reduced IL3 dependency,\nhigher clonogenic potential and self-renewal in primary murine HSPCs. This multiplexed CRISPR\ntechnology o \u000bers a robust and malleable approach for generating murine models of the multitude of\nhuman translocation-associated leukaemias.\n2. Results\n2.1. A CRISPR /Cas9 System for Mll-Af9 Genome Editing (302)\nWe utilized a CRISPR /Cas9 system for the generation of murine t(4;9) MA9 chromosomal\ntranslocations in murine HSPCs, utilizing simultaneous targeting of the Mlland Af9genes by CRISPR\nsgRNAs directed to chromosomes. Based on prior investigation of common MLL and AF9 breakpoint\nregions in AML patient samples [ 49] and murine models of MA9 [ 35], we designed guides targeting\nfrequently translocated intronic regions between Mllexons 8 and 9 (Mll sg1 and 2) and exons 10 and 11\n(Mll sg3 and 4) and between Af9exons 8 and 9 ( Af9sg1, 2 and 3) (Figure 1A) to generate two potential\nMLL-AF9 fusion products (Figure 1B). Guide sequences were generated using the CRISPR.MIT web\ntool (http: //crispr.mit.edu) [ 50,51], which scores each sequence based on a combination of on- and\no\u000b-target potentials. We selected those guides with the highest scores, indicating an appropriate\ne\u000eciency of on-target cleavage with minimal o \u000b-target potential. Single guide sequences were cloned\ninto a lentiviral CRISPR-green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) vector (Supplementary Figure S1), and the\nresultant high-titre lentivirus was used to transduce the murine HSPC myeloid progenitor 32D cell line,\nwhich is IL3-dependent.

Endogenous Generation of MA9 Translocation in Murine HSPCs (368) \nTo generate MLL-AF9 translocations, simultaneous DNA DSBs in the Mll and Af9 genes of \nmurine 32D HSPCs were created (Figure 2A).

Unique banding patterns were seen following electrophoretic \nanalysis of PCR products from 3/4 Mll and Af9 guide combinations (Figures 2C and S3), with sg3/sg3 \nas the only guide combination which did not genera te a product.

Percentage indel formation was calculated by\nquantiﬁcation of each DNA band. Cells transduced with an empty CRISPR vector (Cas9 only) were\nused as the control sample for each.\nOf those guides targeting Mllintrons, Mll sg1-3 showed approximately equal indel e \u000eciencies of\n31–38%, with no cleavage seen using sg4 (Figure 1C and Figure S2). Similarly, Af9-targeting sgRNA1\nand -3 showed approximately equal e \u000eciencies of 28–37%, while sg2 gave a signiﬁcantly poorer indel\nfrequency of 7% (Figure 1C). These data demonstrate e \u000ecient cleavage of Mlland Af9loci using a\nCRISPR system detectable in the bulk population. Based on these results, Mll sg2 was selected for\ntargeting of Mllintrons 8 and 9, sg3 was selected for introns 10 and 11, and Af9 sg1 and –3 were\nselected for Af9introns 8 and 9.\n2.2.

Sequence alignment of \namplicons from samples transduced with alternat ive guide combinations (Figure 2C, red arrows \nexcluding b) identified matches in exonic and intronic regions of the mouse genome, including a noncoding region of chromosome 14 and the Pigz gene on chromosome 16. This may be indicative of \na potential off-target effect of these sgRNA combinations, in line with current knowledge regarding the off-target potential of Cas9 cleavage. RT-PCR and subsequent electrophoresis of RNA from the dual sg2/sg3-transduced sample further validated the translocation at the transcript level; utilizing \nprimers flanking the mRNA breakpoint  region (Figure 2B), we generated an amplicon unique to this \nsample (Figure 2E) which correctly aligned to murine Mll (NM_001357549.1) and Af9 (NM_027326.3) \nreference transcripts, thus supporting formation of the MA9 mRNA fusion (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that CRISPR/Cas9- mediated genome editing can be used to induce \nformation of a murine t(4;9) MA9 translocation in 32D HSPCs and that this fusion gene product is transcribed appropriately. \n \nFigure 2.

CRISPR-Mediated MA9 Translocations Recapitulate Features of MA9 Leukaemia In Vitro (622)\nMultifactorial functional analysis was carried out ﬁrstly on MA9-validated 32D murine HSPCs,\nin which we examined proliferative capability, IL3-dependency and expression of MA9-target genes.\nOver 30 days in liquid culture, we saw no signiﬁcant di \u000berence in proliferation between 32D cells\ntransduced with the sg2 /sg3 guide combination compared to those transduced with either single\nguide (Figure 3A), indicating that the MA9 translocation does not confer a demonstrable proliferative\nadvantage in this already immortalised cell line. MA9 leukemic cells have previously shown only\nmoderate IL3 dependency in contrast to 32D cells which are strictly IL3 dependent [ 52]. Thus, we sought\nto examine the e \u000bects of IL3 starvation on MA9 32D cells in culture. Over 24 h of IL3 starvation, we noted\na slight but nonsigniﬁcant growth advantage and resistance to starvation-induced stress in the MA9\ncells when compared with single guide controls (Figure 3B), suggesting a decrease in IL-3 dependency\nconferred by CRISPR-generated MA9 translocation in this cell type, consistent with previous data [ 52].\nAnalysis of the expression of common MA9-associated genes in sg2 /sg3 double-transduced cells\nrevealed signiﬁcant upregulation of Dot1l ,Cdk6 and Sirt1 mRNA (Figure 3C). Both DOT1l and CDK6\nhave critical and well-established roles in MLLr function and leukemogenesis [ 16,29], and Sirt1 has\nbeen shown to be upregulated in response to MA9 expression in murine models [ 53]. Taken together,\nthese data strongly support that CRISPR-mediated generation of MA9 using the endogenous loci can\nrecapitulate the functional properties of MA9 leukaemic features.\nFollowing veriﬁcation of the MA9 translocation in 32D murine HSPCs, we next sought to use our\napproach in primary murine HSPCs. C-Kit+bone marrow (BM) cells were isolated from WT mice and\ntransduced using the validated sg2 /sg3 sgRNA singly or in combination. At day 5 post-transduction,\ncells were sorted for GFP+and expanded in liquid culture for an additional 5 days prior to beginning\nfunctional analysis of the translocation in the primary bulk cell population. Equal numbers of cells\nfrom liquid cultures were assessed in colony forming cell (CFC) assays to determine self-renewal,\nproliferation and di \u000berentiation capabilities. Following 20 days in a CFC assay, cells transduced\nwith the sg2 /sg3 combination of guides displayed signiﬁcantly increased cell numbers and formed\nmore colonies when compared to single transduced samples (Figure 3D,E). We next carried out\nimmunophenotyping of day 20 CFC colonies in order to assess the myeloid di \u000berentiation status of\nthe cells. We saw di \u000berences neither in the live /viable population (Figure 3G) nor in the CD11bGr1-\nor CD11b +F4/80+myeloid fractions in any of the samples (Figure 3F,I,J), suggesting that the MA9\ntranslocation in this model does not have a negative impact on cell viability or myeloid di \u000berentiation.\nHowever, the sg2 /sg3 MA9 cells showed a signiﬁcantly larger population of cells expressing the c-Kit\nprogenitor marker (Figure 3F,H), which has been associated with the leukaemia stem cell (LSC) in AMLs\nincluding MA9 [ 36,37]. This highlights not only a proliferative advantage in the double-transduced\nMA9 population but also an enrichment of a self-renewing LSC-type population. These data indicate\nthat the CRISPR-mediated generation of the MA9 translocation in murine HSPCs mediates leukaemic\ntransformation, indicated by a proliferative advantage and an increase in self-renewal properties.\nInt.

Discussion\nHerein, we have demonstrated generation of a de novo MA9 translocation in murine HSPCs using\nstate-of-the-art CRISPR /Cas9 technology to create a novel murine leukaemia model which faithfully\nrecapitulates multiple features of human MA9 leukaemia. By rational design of sgRNA ﬂanking\nbreakpoint regions with common occurrence in MLLr AML patients and prior MA9 transgenic models,\nwe identiﬁed optimal combinations of sgRNA sequences with which to induce simultaneous DSBs\nat the speciﬁc loci. Each guide was validated for individual cleavage e \u000eciency, and subsequently,\noptimal combinations were identiﬁed for multiplexed CRISPR genome editing to induce an MA9\nchromosomal translocation in HSPCs. Following CRISPR editing, the presence of a successful\nMA9 translocation was veriﬁed at both the genomic and transcriptional levels by PCR analysis and\nsequencing. Analysis of proliferation, clonogenicity, di \u000berentiation and gene expression robustly\ndemonstrated the functional ways in which this model recapitulates features of the disease in vitro .\nThis novel approach circumvents common caveats of previous methods, with no requirement for\ntransgenic or immunocompromised mice or primary human material. We have demonstrated the\nease of use of this approach in cell line and primary murine HSPCs which can be applied to other\nchromosomal translocations.\nIncreased clonogenicity and enrichment of progenitor cells with increased self-renewal capacity is a\nfundamental characteristic of leukaemias with MLL rearrangements. Although we saw no proliferative\nadvantage in MA9 32D HSPCs, we did observe a modest reduction in growth factor dependence\nas previously demonstrated. Normal primary HSPC cells have limited growth potential in vitro ,\nwhich showed increased colony growth and number when expressing MA9. Increased clonogenicity\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 9 of 15\nis associated with increased c-Kit expression, a cell surface marker found in myeloblasts in up to\n80% of AML cases [ 54]. C-Kit expression has also been strongly associated with poor prognoses in\nother instances of chromosomal translocations such as t(8;21) [ 55]. We saw a signiﬁcant enrichment of\nc-Kit-expressing cells, indicating an enrichment of colony-forming LSC-like early progenitor cells in\nMA9-expressing cells consistent with leukaemic transformation. Assessment of myeloid di \u000berentiation\ndid not reveal a block in expression of di \u000berentiation markers in MA9-mediated cells, indicating that,\nalthough cells have acquired self-renewal properties, they maintain the ability to di \u000berentiate toward the\nmyeloid lineage. A block in terminal myeloid di \u000berentiation cannot be ruled out, and whether cells can\ncomplete myeloid di \u000berentiation remains to be investigated. Cells that are unable to di \u000berentiate to the\nGMP stage of di \u000berentiation in murine models of MLLr do not undergo leukaemic transformation [ 56],\nand so, it is understood that some level of di \u000berentiation down the myeloid pathway is required for\nMLLr AML transformation. Data produced by Stavropoulou et al. utilizing a Dox-inducible MA9\nmodel show that surface marker analysis of colonies derived from iMLL-AF9 LT-HSC and GMP\nsubpopulations showed cells expressing the Mac-1 and Gr-1 di \u000berentiation markers in addition to\nc-Kit in the presence of Dox [39].\nMA9-initiated oncogenesis has been shown to depend on MA9 modiﬁcation of transcriptional\nelongation, resulting in dysregulated expression of target genes. We demonstrated an increase in\nexpression of Dot1 and Cdk6 , both of which are essential for the oncogenic function of MA9-rearranged\ncells [ 29,57]. Interestingly, we also noted a signiﬁcant increase in expression of Sirt1 , which is found\nsigniﬁcantly overexpressed at the protein level in LSC populations from AML patients [ 53], where it\nacts to maintain their survival, growth and drug resistance. The lack of increased HoxA9 expression\nobserved in our cells may be due to low frequency of translocation within the bulk population analysed,\nas has been previously noted in TALEN-focused studies [41,42] and CRISPR-generated models [58].\nRecently, work by Jeong et al. [ 58] similarly demonstrated e \u000ecient generation of MA9 translocations\nby CRISPR /Cas9 technology, utilizing methodologies in line with those described herein. The authors\nused the human system to generate MA9 translocation in human CD34 +cord blood (CB) cells in contrast\nto the murine system we have presented here. Consistent with our results, human MA9-expressing CB\ncells in that study demonstrated a growth advantage in liquid culture and clonal expansion in CFC\nanalysis and induction of AML, ALL and MPAL following transplantation in immunocompromised\nmice. The translocation e \u000eciency achieved by Jeong et al. [ 58] is considerably higher than in previous\nTALEN-generated models of MA9 at around 0.5–1%. However, it is important to note that this e \u000eciency\nremains low overall and so should be taken into consideration when analysing the bulk population.\nIn contrast to the single-cell clonal analysis performed by Jeong et al. [ 58], we are able to demonstrate\nthe leukaemic transformation e \u000bects of CRISPR-generated MA9 in the bulk population that may\nbe masking some e \u000bects such as increased Hox gene expression. A considerable advantage of our\nmethodology which allows e \u000bects to be seen in the bulk population is the reduction in time in culture\nof primary HSPCs that is required with single-clone selection. Further single-cell analysis from bulk\npopulations in both the 32D cell line and primary HSPCS would give further insight into individual\naspects of MA9-mediated and context-speciﬁc gene regulation. A limitation with using primary human\nHSPCs is the requirement for immunocompromised mice for xenografts. Our work is the ﬁrst to\nshow the use of this technology to generate the murine MA9 translocation from the endogenous loci\nfaithfully recapitulating MA9-mediated transformation in murine HSPCs. A signiﬁcant advantage\nof the murine system is the potential for investigation into immune-, gene- and cell-speciﬁc contexts\nusing the myriad of murine genetic models and xenotransplantation approaches.\nOur methodology has several advantages for use in genetic models. The tractability of this system\nis such that we can readily study MA9 translocations in combination with other genetic or epigenetic\nabnormalities. Generation of new sgRNAs targeting sequences of interest are quickly and easily cloned\ninto the CRISPR vector validated in this work and can be multiplexed as required. Our sgRNA target\nsequences were also selected not only for their commonality within MLLr patients but also for their\nprior use in alterative murine models of MA9, and as such, our approach o \u000bers not only a robust model\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 10 of 15\nof human disease but also a means of comparison to alterative methodologies [ 35,41,42]. The work\npresented here and by others [ 48,58] exempliﬁes the ongoing shift towards precise genome editing\nwith CRISPR technologies to quickly and accurately recapitulate human disease in model systems.\nWe have demonstrated the tractability and potential of this methodology in modelling human MA9\nleukaemias, which represents an important advancement in the study of MA9-driven leukaemia.\n4. Materials and Methods\n4.1. Cell Culture\nAll cell cultures were grown at 37\u000eC, 5% CO 2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-239T and\nmurine embryonic ﬁbroblast NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco Modiﬁed Eagle Medium\n(DMEM; Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco,\nPaisley, UK), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Paisley, UK) and 1% Penicillin /Streptomycin (Pen /Strep;\nGibco, Paisley, UK). 32D murine myeloid progenitor cell line HSPCs were maintained in Roswell Park\nMemorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640; Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% WEHI-3B\nconditioned media, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% Pen /Strep. Primary murine HSPCs were cultured\nin DMEM pre-stimulation media supplemented with 15 % FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% Pen /Strep,\n10 ng /mL recombinant murine interleukin-3 (rmIL3; PeproTech, London, UK), 10 ng /mL recombinant\nmurine interleukin-6 (rmIL6; PeproTech, London, UK) and 100 ng /mL recombinant murine stem cell\nfactor (rmSCF; PeproTech, London, UK) immediately following isolation and were transferred to\nDMEM activation media supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% Pen /Strep, 10 ng /mL\nrmIL3, 10 ng /mL rmIL6, 100 ng /mL rmSCF and 4 \u0016g/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK)\nfor transduction.\n4.2. Murine Bone Marrow (BM) Harvest and c-Kit Enrichment\nC57BL /6 mice were purchased from Charles River UK and housed in the Beatson Biological\nService and Research Units. All mouse experiments were approved by the local animal welfare ethical\nreview body (AWERB) committee and United Kingdom (UK) home o \u000ece and performed according\nto UK Home O \u000ece project license 60 /4512 approved 25 April 2013(Animal Scientiﬁc Procedures Act\n1986) guidelines. Femur, tibia and pelvic girdle of wild-type (WT) C57BL /6 mice were crushed in\nphosphate bu \u000bered saline (PBS) /2% FBS and passed through a 40- \u0016M cell strainer (Fisher Scientiﬁc,\nLoughborough, UK) to harvest BM. C-kit enrichment was carried out by magnetic activated cell sorting\n(MACS) separation of BM samples following incubation with anti-CD117 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech,\nBergisch Gladbach, Germany).\n4.3. sgRNA Design, Synthesis and CRISPR Transduction\nReference mRNA transcripts of genes of interest (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /nucleotide /) were\nused for identiﬁcation of suitable protospacer sequences using the CRISPR MIT tool (previously\navailable at http: //crispr.mit.edu; accessed August 2015) [50,51]. Top and bottom strand protospacers\nwere purchased as single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligos (IDT, Surrey, UK) (Supplementary Table S1)\nand cloned into pL.CRISPR.EFS.GFP (Supplementary Methods and Figure S1). pL-CRISPR.EFS.GFP\nwas a gift from Benjamin Ebert (Addgene plasmid # 57818) [ 59]. The all-in-one CRISPR lentivirus\nwas used to constitutively express sgRNAs and Cas9 under the control of human U6 (hU6) and\nelongation factor 1 \u000b(EF-1 \u000b) promotors, respectively. HEK-293T and NIH-3T3 cells were used for\nlentiviral production and titration, respectively, and 32D or primary murine HSPCs were transduced\nwith high-titre CRISPR lentivirus as previously described [60].\n4.4. Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting\nSamples were stained and analysed in PBS or PBS /2% FBS or sorted for GFP in the same bu \u000ber.\nSingle cells were gated by forward scatter area (FSC-A) vs height (FSC-H), and then viable cells were\nInt.

Genomic Target Ampliﬁcation (GTA)\nGenomic DNA was extracted from GFP-sorted cells (day 5 post-sorting) using Epicentre\nQuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution. PCR ampliﬁcation of target loci was performed using\nQ5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs; NEB, Herts, UK), and the products were\nanalysed on 2% agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) gel. Bands of interest were excised using the\nGeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA Cleanup Micro Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Paisley, UK) before analysis\nby Sanger sequencing. Primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table S3.\n4.7. Reverse Transcription PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from GFP-sorted cells (day 5 post-sorting) by either Arcturus PicoPure\nRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Paisley, UK) or RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Manchester, UK)),\nand target-speciﬁc cDNA synthesis was carried out by Superscript III (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Paisley,\nUK) using primers speciﬁc for locus of interest. cDNA was ampliﬁed using Taq DNA polymerase\n(NEB, Herts, UK) and target-speciﬁc primers. Puriﬁed products were analysed on 2% agarose gel,\nand bands of interest were excised and analysed by Sanger sequencing. Primer sequences can be found\nin Supplementary Table S4.\n4.8. Gene Expression Analysis (qRT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from GFP-sorted cells, and gene expression analysis was carried out as\npreviously described [ 60]. Results were calculated by the DDCt method with normalization to the Gusb\nhousekeeping gene. Primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table S5.\n4.9. Colony-Forming Cell (CFC) Assay\nMethocult GF M3434 (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) methylcellulose media\ncontaining recombinant murine stem cell factor (rmSCF), recombinant murine interleukin-3 (rmIL-3),\nrecombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) was used.\nEqual numbers of BM c-kit-enriched, GFP-sorted cells were prepared in triplicate and resuspended\nin culture media. Cell suspension was added to methylcellulose and transferred to 3 \u000235 mm\ndishes (Greiner-Bio-One, Gloucestershire, UK) for 10–20 days. Colonies were scored, and cells were\nanalysed by ﬂow cytometry. If required, cells were replated to a second round of CFC following the\nsame protocol.\n4.10. Statistics\nGraphPad Prism (version 5.00.288; LA Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis and\ngraphing.

MLL rearrangements ( MLLr ) are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities\nin infant and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)\nand do not normally acquire secondary mutations compared to other leukaemias. To model these\nleukaemias, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /Cas9\ngene editing to induce MLL-AF9 (MA9) chromosomal rearrangements in murine hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cell lines and primary cells. By utilizing a dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA)\napproach targeting the breakpoint cluster region of murine Mll and Af9 equivalent to that in human\nMA9 rearrangements, we show e \u000ecient de novo generation of MA9 fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels in the bulk population. The leukaemic features of MA9-induced disease were\nobserved including increased clonogenicity, enrichment of c-Kit-positive leukaemic stem cells and\nincreased MA9 target gene expression. This approach provided a rapid and reliable means of de\nnovo generation of Mll-Af9 genetic rearrangements in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor\ncells (HSPCs), using CRISPR /Cas9 technology to produce a cellular model of MA9 leukaemias which\nfaithfully reproduces many features of the human disease in vitro.\nKeywords: CRISPR /Cas9; chromosomal translocation; mixed lineage leukaemia; tumourigenesis;\nstem cells\n1. Introduction\nRearrangements of the mixed lineage leukaemia gene ( MLLr ) are the most common cytogenetic\nabnormalities found in infant and childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid\nleukaemia (AML) [ 1] and are found in 80% and 35–50% of all paediatric ALL and AML cases\nrespectively [ 1]. These leukaemias do not typically acquire many secondary mutations [ 2] and are\nthought to result from inappropriate repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) via nonhomologous\nend joining (NHEJ) in haematopoietic cells [ 3]. As the 8.3-kb breakpoint cluster region of mixed\nlineage leukaemia ( MLL ) is located between exons 8 and 13 for almost all MLLr cases [ 4], these fusion\ngenes contain the ﬁrst 8–13 exons of MLL and a variable number of exons from the fusion partner\ngenes (FPGs). Up to 135 MLL FPGs have been identiﬁed and are well described elsewhere [ 5–7].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266; doi:10.3390 /ijms21124266 www.mdpi.com /journal /ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 2 of 15\nThese include cytoplasmic proteins (AF6, GAS7 and EEN), septins (SEPT2, SEPT5, SEPT6, SEPT9\nand SEPT11) and histone acetyltransferases (CBP and P300) as well as the largest subset, the nuclear\nproteins. This category contains the most common FPGs such as ENL ,ELL,AF4,AF9 and AF10 ,\nwhich account for approximately 80% of all MLL fusions [ 5]. Of these, MLL-AF9 (MA9) t(9;11)(p22;q23)\ntranslocations are found in 30% of MLLr AML cases [ 5] irrespective of age and are commonly found in\na subset of adult patients with therapy-related AML [8].\nAlthough the precise functional properties of AF9 are unknown, it has been demonstrated to\nform multimer complexes with members of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) complex\nand disruptor of telomere silencing ( DOT1L ) via a conserved ANC1 homology domain (AHD),\nindicating a role in transcriptional regulation [ 9,10]. These properties appear to play a critical role in\nleukaemic transformation [ 11,12]. Oncogenic properties of MLL fusion proteins include interference\nwith transcriptional elongation, resulting in dysregulation of target genes [ 13,14]. Aberrant expression\nof MLL target genes is strongly dependent on DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation [ 15], which is\na critical requirement for MA9 leukaemogensis [ 16]. Members of the Homeobox ( HOX ) family are\ncommonly overexpressed in MLLr leukaemias as a direct target of MLL fusion proteins [ 4,17]. The HOX\nfamily are critical factors in the self-renewing properties of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their\noverexpression results in a di \u000berentiation block and an increase in self-renewal of immature myeloid\nprogenitor cells. The HOX cofactors MEIS1 [18,19] and PBX3 [20] are also direct targets of MLL fusion\nproteins [ 21] frequently found upregulated in coordination with HOX targets. Importantly, there is\nevidence to suggest that MA9-mediated leukaemia can progress even in the absence of HOX genes\nsuch as HOXA9 [22], indicating an important role of non- HOX family genes. This includes CDK6 [23],\nEVI-1 [24,25] and EYA1 [26,27], which are also found upregulated in MLLr leukaemias as a result of\ndirect binding of MLL-FPG proteins to gene promoters [ 26,28,29], and play a vital role in leukaemic\ntransformation including cellular immortalization [ 26], hyperproliferation [ 23,24], chemoresistance [ 24]\nand dysregulated self-renewal [ 25,27]. CDK6 speciﬁcally has been highlighted as a critical e \u000bector of\nMLLr leukemogenesis as its depletion in mice with MA9-driven AML was shown to overcome the\nmyeloid di \u000berentiation block and to prolong survival in vivo [29].\nNumerous murine models of MLLr have been generated and have each o \u000bered valuable insights.\nLimitations with murine models are in large part due to the technology used to mimic MLL chromosomal\nrearrangements. An early knock-in model [ 30] utilized homologous recombination (HR) to generate\nanMll-Af9 fusion gene and displayed a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), leading primarily to AML\ncharacterized by expansion of immature myeloid populations with a small percentage developing\nB-cell ALL (B-ALL) [ 31]; thus, this model resembles the phenotypic heterogeneity of MLLr leukaemias,\nwhich can manifest as AML; ALL; or in a minority of cases, mixed phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL).\nHowever, this system lacked tissue-speciﬁc control of MA9 expression throughout development and\nmice were prone to developmental defects as a result of heterozygosity for wild type (WT) Mll[32].\nTo gain more insight into cell-type speciﬁc e \u000bects, a subsequent approach involved enrichment of\nhaematopoietic populations from these HR-generated MA9 knock-in mice, followed by secondary\ntransplantation into WT recipients [ 33]. This also demonstrated e \u000ecient generation of AML, especially\nwhen Lin\u0000Sca-1 +c-Kit+(LSK) cells, which include HSCs and haematopoietic stem and progenitor\n(HSPCs), were transplanted. An advantage of these methods is the expression of the MA9 transgene from\nthe endogenous Mllpromoter, which results in physiological transgene expression levels. This model\ncannot however address the leukaemia stem cell origin with respect to de novo AML initiation.\nTranslocator models utilizing the Cre-loxP system have generated MA9 translocations via loxP\nsites inserted into those intronic regions of endogenous Mlland Af9genes where breakpoints are\nmost frequently found in human MLLr patients [ 34]. Using Lmo2-Cre to express Cre recombinase,\nMll-Af9 was generated in pluripotent stem cells and led exclusively to myeloid leukaemia whereas\nT-cell-restricted expression using lck-Cre did not lead to leukomogeneis [ 35]. The advantage of\nthis Cre-loxP system is that MA9 expression can be driven by lineage-restricted promoters from\nthe endogenous loci [ 35], reﬂecting physiological expression. Further models targeting Mll-Af9\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 3 of 15\nexpression to speciﬁc cells within the haematopoietic system have utilized retrovirus-driven expression\nfollowed by transduction and transplantation approaches. These methods beneﬁt from its speed\nand ease of use [ 36,37] and has led to the identiﬁcation of both the HSC and the granulocyte and\nmacrophage progenitor (GMP) as potential leukaemic stem cells-of-origin with divergent clinical\nfeatures [ 38]. Retrovirus-mediated expression models however drive transgene expressions that\nare not physiological. To gain greater control over the level of cell-restricted transgene expression,\nDox-inducible transgenic models have since been developed [ 39,40] enabling close-to-physiological\nlevels and reversible transgene expression in a Dox dose-dependent manner. Using this model, it was\ndemonstrated that long-term HSC (LT-HSC) populations result in an invasive and chemoresistant AML\nwith a primitive progenitor phenotype and a distinct stemness-related gene expression pattern [ 39].\nDox-inducible transgene expression is however not controlled by an endogenous promoter. “Leaky” Cre\nexpression from tissue-speciﬁc promoters together with the expensive and time-consuming nature of\ntissue-restricted strain generation are major limitations with the Cre-loxP and Dox-inducible transgenic\nmodel systems. More recent attempts to circumvent some of the issues highlighted above have utilized\ntranscription activator like e \u000bector nucleases (TALEN) technology to generate endogenous MA9 [ 41,42].\nThese cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher clonogenic potential with colony morphologies consistent\nwith an immature cell type and development of AML, ALL and MPAL upon xenotransplantation [ 41].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /Cas9 technology facilitates\ncreation of DSBs at almost any genomic sequence of interest technology and has revolutionised the\nway in which we are able to manipulate the genome, a \u000bording a more ﬂexible and readily applicable\nmethod for generating novel disease models, including chromosomal translocations, with an ease and\nsimplicity far outweighing prior technologies such as TALEN and Cre-LoxP . CRISPR technology has\nfacilitated generation of chromosomal deletions [ 43] and rearrangements, including inversions [ 44] and\ntranslocations [ 45–48]. Here, we demonstrate e \u000ecient CRISPR-mediated generation of an endogenous\nMll-Af9 reciprocal translocation in a murine cell line and primary HSPCs. By utilizing a dual-single\nguide RNA (sgRNA) approach to target the most common breakpoints in human MA9 rearrangements,\nwe show rapid, reliable generation of simultaneous breakpoints and a fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels. The resultant transformed cells reliably recapitulated features of human MLLr\nleukaemias. These include increased expression of MA9 target genes, reduced IL3 dependency,\nhigher clonogenic potential and self-renewal in primary murine HSPCs. This multiplexed CRISPR\ntechnology o \u000bers a robust and malleable approach for generating murine models of the multitude of\nhuman translocation-associated leukaemias.\n2. Results\n2.1. A CRISPR /Cas9 System for Mll-Af9 Genome Editing (302)\nWe utilized a CRISPR /Cas9 system for the generation of murine t(4;9) MA9 chromosomal\ntranslocations in murine HSPCs, utilizing simultaneous targeting of the Mlland Af9genes by CRISPR\nsgRNAs directed to chromosomes. Based on prior investigation of common MLL and AF9 breakpoint\nregions in AML patient samples [ 49] and murine models of MA9 [ 35], we designed guides targeting\nfrequently translocated intronic regions between Mllexons 8 and 9 (Mll sg1 and 2) and exons 10 and 11\n(Mll sg3 and 4) and between Af9exons 8 and 9 ( Af9sg1, 2 and 3) (Figure 1A) to generate two potential\nMLL-AF9 fusion products (Figure 1B). Guide sequences were generated using the CRISPR.MIT web\ntool (http: //crispr.mit.edu) [ 50,51], which scores each sequence based on a combination of on- and\no\u000b-target potentials. We selected those guides with the highest scores, indicating an appropriate\ne\u000eciency of on-target cleavage with minimal o \u000b-target potential. Single guide sequences were cloned\ninto a lentiviral CRISPR-green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) vector (Supplementary Figure S1), and the\nresultant high-titre lentivirus was used to transduce the murine HSPC myeloid progenitor 32D cell line,\nwhich is IL3-dependent.

CRISPR-Mediated MA9 Translocations Recapitulate Features of MA9 Leukaemia In Vitro (622)\nMultifactorial functional analysis was carried out ﬁrstly on MA9-validated 32D murine HSPCs,\nin which we examined proliferative capability, IL3-dependency and expression of MA9-target genes.\nOver 30 days in liquid culture, we saw no signiﬁcant di \u000berence in proliferation between 32D cells\ntransduced with the sg2 /sg3 guide combination compared to those transduced with either single\nguide (Figure 3A), indicating that the MA9 translocation does not confer a demonstrable proliferative\nadvantage in this already immortalised cell line. MA9 leukemic cells have previously shown only\nmoderate IL3 dependency in contrast to 32D cells which are strictly IL3 dependent [ 52]. Thus, we sought\nto examine the e \u000bects of IL3 starvation on MA9 32D cells in culture. Over 24 h of IL3 starvation, we noted\na slight but nonsigniﬁcant growth advantage and resistance to starvation-induced stress in the MA9\ncells when compared with single guide controls (Figure 3B), suggesting a decrease in IL-3 dependency\nconferred by CRISPR-generated MA9 translocation in this cell type, consistent with previous data [ 52].\nAnalysis of the expression of common MA9-associated genes in sg2 /sg3 double-transduced cells\nrevealed signiﬁcant upregulation of Dot1l ,Cdk6 and Sirt1 mRNA (Figure 3C). Both DOT1l and CDK6\nhave critical and well-established roles in MLLr function and leukemogenesis [ 16,29], and Sirt1 has\nbeen shown to be upregulated in response to MA9 expression in murine models [ 53]. Taken together,\nthese data strongly support that CRISPR-mediated generation of MA9 using the endogenous loci can\nrecapitulate the functional properties of MA9 leukaemic features.\nFollowing veriﬁcation of the MA9 translocation in 32D murine HSPCs, we next sought to use our\napproach in primary murine HSPCs. C-Kit+bone marrow (BM) cells were isolated from WT mice and\ntransduced using the validated sg2 /sg3 sgRNA singly or in combination. At day 5 post-transduction,\ncells were sorted for GFP+and expanded in liquid culture for an additional 5 days prior to beginning\nfunctional analysis of the translocation in the primary bulk cell population. Equal numbers of cells\nfrom liquid cultures were assessed in colony forming cell (CFC) assays to determine self-renewal,\nproliferation and di \u000berentiation capabilities. Following 20 days in a CFC assay, cells transduced\nwith the sg2 /sg3 combination of guides displayed signiﬁcantly increased cell numbers and formed\nmore colonies when compared to single transduced samples (Figure 3D,E). We next carried out\nimmunophenotyping of day 20 CFC colonies in order to assess the myeloid di \u000berentiation status of\nthe cells. We saw di \u000berences neither in the live /viable population (Figure 3G) nor in the CD11bGr1-\nor CD11b +F4/80+myeloid fractions in any of the samples (Figure 3F,I,J), suggesting that the MA9\ntranslocation in this model does not have a negative impact on cell viability or myeloid di \u000berentiation.\nHowever, the sg2 /sg3 MA9 cells showed a signiﬁcantly larger population of cells expressing the c-Kit\nprogenitor marker (Figure 3F,H), which has been associated with the leukaemia stem cell (LSC) in AMLs\nincluding MA9 [ 36,37]. This highlights not only a proliferative advantage in the double-transduced\nMA9 population but also an enrichment of a self-renewing LSC-type population. These data indicate\nthat the CRISPR-mediated generation of the MA9 translocation in murine HSPCs mediates leukaemic\ntransformation, indicated by a proliferative advantage and an increase in self-renewal properties.\nInt.

Discussion\nHerein, we have demonstrated generation of a de novo MA9 translocation in murine HSPCs using\nstate-of-the-art CRISPR /Cas9 technology to create a novel murine leukaemia model which faithfully\nrecapitulates multiple features of human MA9 leukaemia. By rational design of sgRNA ﬂanking\nbreakpoint regions with common occurrence in MLLr AML patients and prior MA9 transgenic models,\nwe identiﬁed optimal combinations of sgRNA sequences with which to induce simultaneous DSBs\nat the speciﬁc loci. Each guide was validated for individual cleavage e \u000eciency, and subsequently,\noptimal combinations were identiﬁed for multiplexed CRISPR genome editing to induce an MA9\nchromosomal translocation in HSPCs. Following CRISPR editing, the presence of a successful\nMA9 translocation was veriﬁed at both the genomic and transcriptional levels by PCR analysis and\nsequencing. Analysis of proliferation, clonogenicity, di \u000berentiation and gene expression robustly\ndemonstrated the functional ways in which this model recapitulates features of the disease in vitro .\nThis novel approach circumvents common caveats of previous methods, with no requirement for\ntransgenic or immunocompromised mice or primary human material. We have demonstrated the\nease of use of this approach in cell line and primary murine HSPCs which can be applied to other\nchromosomal translocations.\nIncreased clonogenicity and enrichment of progenitor cells with increased self-renewal capacity is a\nfundamental characteristic of leukaemias with MLL rearrangements. Although we saw no proliferative\nadvantage in MA9 32D HSPCs, we did observe a modest reduction in growth factor dependence\nas previously demonstrated. Normal primary HSPC cells have limited growth potential in vitro ,\nwhich showed increased colony growth and number when expressing MA9. Increased clonogenicity\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 9 of 15\nis associated with increased c-Kit expression, a cell surface marker found in myeloblasts in up to\n80% of AML cases [ 54]. C-Kit expression has also been strongly associated with poor prognoses in\nother instances of chromosomal translocations such as t(8;21) [ 55]. We saw a signiﬁcant enrichment of\nc-Kit-expressing cells, indicating an enrichment of colony-forming LSC-like early progenitor cells in\nMA9-expressing cells consistent with leukaemic transformation. Assessment of myeloid di \u000berentiation\ndid not reveal a block in expression of di \u000berentiation markers in MA9-mediated cells, indicating that,\nalthough cells have acquired self-renewal properties, they maintain the ability to di \u000berentiate toward the\nmyeloid lineage. A block in terminal myeloid di \u000berentiation cannot be ruled out, and whether cells can\ncomplete myeloid di \u000berentiation remains to be investigated. Cells that are unable to di \u000berentiate to the\nGMP stage of di \u000berentiation in murine models of MLLr do not undergo leukaemic transformation [ 56],\nand so, it is understood that some level of di \u000berentiation down the myeloid pathway is required for\nMLLr AML transformation. Data produced by Stavropoulou et al. utilizing a Dox-inducible MA9\nmodel show that surface marker analysis of colonies derived from iMLL-AF9 LT-HSC and GMP\nsubpopulations showed cells expressing the Mac-1 and Gr-1 di \u000berentiation markers in addition to\nc-Kit in the presence of Dox [39].\nMA9-initiated oncogenesis has been shown to depend on MA9 modiﬁcation of transcriptional\nelongation, resulting in dysregulated expression of target genes. We demonstrated an increase in\nexpression of Dot1 and Cdk6 , both of which are essential for the oncogenic function of MA9-rearranged\ncells [ 29,57]. Interestingly, we also noted a signiﬁcant increase in expression of Sirt1 , which is found\nsigniﬁcantly overexpressed at the protein level in LSC populations from AML patients [ 53], where it\nacts to maintain their survival, growth and drug resistance. The lack of increased HoxA9 expression\nobserved in our cells may be due to low frequency of translocation within the bulk population analysed,\nas has been previously noted in TALEN-focused studies [41,42] and CRISPR-generated models [58].\nRecently, work by Jeong et al. [ 58] similarly demonstrated e \u000ecient generation of MA9 translocations\nby CRISPR /Cas9 technology, utilizing methodologies in line with those described herein. The authors\nused the human system to generate MA9 translocation in human CD34 +cord blood (CB) cells in contrast\nto the murine system we have presented here. Consistent with our results, human MA9-expressing CB\ncells in that study demonstrated a growth advantage in liquid culture and clonal expansion in CFC\nanalysis and induction of AML, ALL and MPAL following transplantation in immunocompromised\nmice. The translocation e \u000eciency achieved by Jeong et al. [ 58] is considerably higher than in previous\nTALEN-generated models of MA9 at around 0.5–1%. However, it is important to note that this e \u000eciency\nremains low overall and so should be taken into consideration when analysing the bulk population.\nIn contrast to the single-cell clonal analysis performed by Jeong et al. [ 58], we are able to demonstrate\nthe leukaemic transformation e \u000bects of CRISPR-generated MA9 in the bulk population that may\nbe masking some e \u000bects such as increased Hox gene expression. A considerable advantage of our\nmethodology which allows e \u000bects to be seen in the bulk population is the reduction in time in culture\nof primary HSPCs that is required with single-clone selection. Further single-cell analysis from bulk\npopulations in both the 32D cell line and primary HSPCS would give further insight into individual\naspects of MA9-mediated and context-speciﬁc gene regulation. A limitation with using primary human\nHSPCs is the requirement for immunocompromised mice for xenografts. Our work is the ﬁrst to\nshow the use of this technology to generate the murine MA9 translocation from the endogenous loci\nfaithfully recapitulating MA9-mediated transformation in murine HSPCs. A signiﬁcant advantage\nof the murine system is the potential for investigation into immune-, gene- and cell-speciﬁc contexts\nusing the myriad of murine genetic models and xenotransplantation approaches.\nOur methodology has several advantages for use in genetic models. The tractability of this system\nis such that we can readily study MA9 translocations in combination with other genetic or epigenetic\nabnormalities. Generation of new sgRNAs targeting sequences of interest are quickly and easily cloned\ninto the CRISPR vector validated in this work and can be multiplexed as required. Our sgRNA target\nsequences were also selected not only for their commonality within MLLr patients but also for their\nprior use in alterative murine models of MA9, and as such, our approach o \u000bers not only a robust model\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 4266 10 of 15\nof human disease but also a means of comparison to alterative methodologies [ 35,41,42]. The work\npresented here and by others [ 48,58] exempliﬁes the ongoing shift towards precise genome editing\nwith CRISPR technologies to quickly and accurately recapitulate human disease in model systems.\nWe have demonstrated the tractability and potential of this methodology in modelling human MA9\nleukaemias, which represents an important advancement in the study of MA9-driven leukaemia.\n4.

Reverse Transcription PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from GFP-sorted cells (day 5 post-sorting) by either Arcturus PicoPure\nRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Paisley, UK) or RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Manchester, UK)),\nand target-speciﬁc cDNA synthesis was carried out by Superscript III (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Paisley,\nUK) using primers speciﬁc for locus of interest. cDNA was ampliﬁed using Taq DNA polymerase\n(NEB, Herts, UK) and target-speciﬁc primers. Puriﬁed products were analysed on 2% agarose gel,\nand bands of interest were excised and analysed by Sanger sequencing. Primer sequences can be found\nin Supplementary Table S4.\n4.8. Gene Expression Analysis (qRT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from GFP-sorted cells, and gene expression analysis was carried out as\npreviously described [ 60]. Results were calculated by the DDCt method with normalization to the Gusb\nhousekeeping gene. Primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table S5.\n4.9. Colony-Forming Cell (CFC) Assay\nMethocult GF M3434 (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) methylcellulose media\ncontaining recombinant murine stem cell factor (rmSCF), recombinant murine interleukin-3 (rmIL-3),\nrecombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) was used.\nEqual numbers of BM c-kit-enriched, GFP-sorted cells were prepared in triplicate and resuspended\nin culture media. Cell suspension was added to methylcellulose and transferred to 3 \u000235 mm\ndishes (Greiner-Bio-One, Gloucestershire, UK) for 10–20 days. Colonies were scored, and cells were\nanalysed by ﬂow cytometry. If required, cells were replated to a second round of CFC following the\nsame protocol.\n4.10. Statistics\nGraphPad Prism (version 5.00.288; LA Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis and\ngraphing. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest.\nSupplementary Materials: Supplementary materials can be found at http: //www.mdpi.com /1422-0067 /21/12/\n4266/s1.\nInt.

Wefoundthatunabsorbed antisera toleukaemias showedlittleornospecificity\nagainstleukaemia cellsrelativetonon-thymic lymphocytes, butspecificity appeared after\nabsorption withamixture ofliver,kidney,andspleen.Antisera prepared againstnormal\ntissueswerealsotested(Asakuma andReif,1968).\nInthisstudy,antisera havebeenprepared againstfourdifferent leukaemias, againsta\nmixture oftheseleukaemias, andagainstanovarianteratoma. Theseantisera weretested\nagainsteachofthevariousleukaemias andagainstcertainnormaltissues.Twoassaysof\nantibody activity wereused:immune cytolysis, andcomplement fixation.\nMATERIALS ANDMETHODS\nMiceandleukaemias\nAllmicewereobtained fromtheJackson Laboratory.

Lymphocytic leukaemia L1210ofDBA/2micewasderivedbyLaw,Dunn,\nBoyleandMiller(1949).BothGardner andL1210leukaemias wereprovided byMrI.\nWodinsky ofArthurD.Little,Inc.Leukaemia RA9originated spontaneously inanAKR\nmouse;cellsfromtheenlarged spleenandthymus wereinitiallytransplanted inour\nlaboratory inMay1968.\nTheH-2genotype ofthestrainsoforiginofthevarious tumours andleukaemias areas\nfollows:C57BL/6, H-2b;BALB/c andDBA/2,H-2d;AKR,C3HandC3HeB/Fe, H-2k\n(SnellandStimpfling, 1966).\nAntisera\nRabbits wereimmunized withmousetissuesbytwocoursesofinjection. Eachcourse\nconsisted ofonesubcutaneous injection of1-2mloftumourcellsincorporated inFreund-\nMcDermott complete adjuvant (ReifandNorris,1960),followedbyfivetosevenintra-\nvenousinjections (spaced over3weeks)of5mlof1percentsuspensions ofviableleukaemia\ncellsinisotonicsaline.Antisera wereinactivated byheating at560for30minutes and\nabsorbed with1/13volumeofAKRplasma,followed bythreeabsorptions, eachwith1/10\nvolumeofpacked mouseerythrocytes for30minutes atroomtemperature, aspreviously1088\nSpecificity ofAntiseraagainstLeukaemias\ndescribed (ReifandAllen,1964).Normal rabbitserum(NRS)wasinactivated butnot\nabsorbed. Antisera werestoredinsmallportions at-200withoutpreservative.\nRabbitantisera weretestedeitherwhole(-winTables1and2),orelseyGfractions\n(-yG)wereprepared byprecipitation with40percentammonium sulphate, followed by\nbatch-fractionation withDEAE-cellulose (Reif,1969).Antisera toleukaemia Mand\novarian tumour E6Aweretreatedsimilarly, exceptthatammonium sulphate precipita-\ntionwasomitted. Antiserum Xwasprepared byinjection ofamixture ofleukaemias\nRA9,Gardner, L1210,CandM.\nCytolysisassaysystem\nAsmall-scale assaysystem(ReifandAllen,1964)wasused.Inoutline,eachassaytube\ncontained 100,000viablelymphocytes, suitably absorbed 10percentcomplement (Reif,\n1962),andvariousdilutions ofantiserum. Tubeswereincubated for1hourat370and\nplacedinicewater.Foreachtubeinturn,thesupernatant wassuckedoffthecellsthathad\nsettled,0f02mlofvitaldyewasadded,and200cellswereclassified underthemicroscope\nasstainedorunstained. Results, inpercentage ofstainedcells,wereplottedagainstfinal\nantiserum concentration (percent),andthecytolytic titrewasreadat50percentstained\ncells,withacorrection forstainedcellsinthecontroltube(Reif,1962).Thepotency* of\nanantiserum wasexpressed as100dividedbythecytolytic titreobtained inthisassay\nsystem(ReifandAllen,1964).\nComplement fixation\nAsmall-scale modification (Asakuma andReif,1968)ofthecomplement (C)fixation\nmethodofMayer(1961)wasused.\nInoutline,serialdoubling dilutions ofantiserum wereassayedforcomplement fixation\nwithknownnumbers oftissuecells,orelsewithaknownwetweightofatissuehomo-\ngenate.Disappearance ofcomplement wasdetermined bythefailureofantibody-sensitized\nsheeperythrocytes, whichwereaddedlater,tohaemolyse. Reaction conditions and\ncontrols wereaspreviously described (Asakuma andReif,1968).\nThefinalconcentration ofantiserum intheexperimental tubeswasplottedagainstper\ncenthaemolysis onsemilogarithmic paper.Fromthisplot,theCfixation titreoftheanti-\nserumwasreadasthefinalpercentage concentration ofantiserum at50percenthaemo-\nlysis,aftercorrection forCfixationincontroltubes.TheCfixation potency* wascalcu-\nlatedas100dividedbytheCfixation titre(Asakuma andReif,1968).\nRESULTS\nIMMUNE CYTOLYSIS\nRabbitantiserawereprepared byhyperimmunization ofgroupsofrabbitswithdifferent\nleukaemias ortumours.

Thesameantisera were\ntherefore testedbyCfixationagainstleukaemias ofthreedifferent H-2genotypes, and\nagainstvariousnormalDBA/2tissues(Table2).\nNormalrabbitserum(firsttwolines,Table2)showedweakreactivity againstleukaemia\nL1210.\nAntiserum C-yG(thirdline)showedstronger Cfixationwithleukaemia L1210thanwith\notherleukaemias.

Portions ofthisabsorbed antiserum (AA)were\nfurtherabsorbed withlymphocytes (lymphnode,splenicandthymic) andonceagainwith\nwashedresidues ofliverandkidney.Theratioofthenumber ofDBA/2micefromwhich\nthesetissueswerederived tothevolume ofantiserum (ml)varied asfollows: (a)1:10,\n(b)1:3,(c)1:1,(d)3:1.Allabsorptions weredonefor30minutes at370.Eachportionof\nseparately absorbed antiserum wastestedbyimmune cytolysis againstL1210cells,lymph\nnodelymphocytes, andspleniclymphocytes.\nRelative toantiserum AA,themeancytolytic potencies ofportions absorbed according\ntoschedules (a),(b),(c)and(d)above were47,25,12and5-6percent,respectively,\nwhendetermined against L1210cells.Foranyportion ofantiserum, thecytolytic potency\nagainstL1210cells,divided bythecytolytic potency againstlymphnodelymphocytes,\nwasameasure ofthespecificity ofaparticular portion ofantiserum againstleukaemia cells\nrelative tonormallymphocytes (Reif,AllenandMcVety, 1965).Thevaluesofthis\n'specificity ratio'forantiserum portions (a),(b),(c)and(d)were054,0-72,074and\n126,compared to0-65forantiserum AA.Theequivalent specificity ratiosforthereaction\nagainstL1210cellsrelative tospleniclymphocytes were129,138,1-57and234,com-\nparedto090forantiserum AA.Whencompared tothereaction witheitherlymphnode or\nspleniclymphocytes, asubstantial increase inspecificity against L1210leukaemia cells\nwasthusobtained onlywithschedule (d),which represents verythorough absorption and\nconcomitantly highlossofcytolytic potency.\nDISCUSSION\nHeterologous antisera havelongbeenusedforthetreatment ofhuman leukaemia\n(Lindstrom, 1927;Brittingham andChaplin, 1960). While interest hasquickened\nrecently (Sekla,Holeckova, Janele, Libnaisky andHnevkovsky, 1967;Tsirimbas, Pfisterer,\nHornung, Thierfelder, Michlmayr andStich,1969;Fernbach, Rossen andButler, 1970;\nMempel andThierfelder, 1970), thereisnoconvincing evidence thatsuch seraproduce\norprolong remissions inhuman leukaemia. Thepresent model studyinmiceisnotcon-\ncernedwiththeinvivoeffectiveness ofsuch sera,buthelps toanswer questions thatarise\nintheirpreparation. Forinstance, mustantisera tohuman leukaemias beprepared by\nimmunizations ofanimals withleukaemias ofthe sameHL-A type asthepatient tobe\ntreated? Canimmunization withamixture ofleukaemias produce antisera potent against\nleukaemias ofdifferent HL-A types?Resolution ofthese questions must await experi-\nmentation inman.However, thereisasufficiently closeparallel between theH-2system1093\nA.E.ReifandChung-Ai H.Kim\nofmiceandtheHL-Asystemofman,thatworkwithmiceisapttoprovideusefulsug-\ngestions astothelikelyoutcome ofequivalent workinman.\nCELLULAR ANTIGENS\nWhatmurineantigens areabletostimulate formation ofantibodies inrabbits? Four\nclassesofcellsurfaceantigens comeintoconsideration: allogenic, organ-specific, tumour-\nspecificandspecies-specific.\nWithfewexceptions (SnellandStimpfling, 1966),allogenic specificities suchasH-1to\nH-l1,TLand0areexpressed onthecellsurfaceofthecorresponding leukaemias. To\npredictthecross-reactions ofantisera prepared againstdifferent leukaemias, itmustbe\nremembered thatmousestrains(andtherefore alsoleukaemias) ofdifferent H-2genotype\noftensharesomeH-2antigens. Forinstance, leukaemia C(H-2b)sharesH-2specificity\nNo.5withleukaemias Gardner andRA9(bothH-2k)andspecificities Nos.6,14,27,28\nand29withleukaemia L1210(H-2d),whileL1210sharesspecificities Nos.3and8with\nleukaemias Gardner andRA9(SnellandStimpfling, 1966).\nInthepresentstudy,antisera prepared byimmunization withaleukaemia ofacertainagenotype weremostpotentforimmune cytolysis ofleukaemias ofthesameH-2genotype\ninthecaseofantisera GandE6A(Table1).Similarly, antiserum TMreacted more\nstrongly againstL1210cells(alsoofgenotype H-2d)thanallseraotherthanthoseprepared\nbyinjection ofL1210cells(seraLandX).TheresultsforantiseraCandLarenotreadily\nevaluated, sincetheseweretheonlyleukaemias testedthatwereofH-2bandH-2dgeno-\ntypes,respectively.\nWithregardtothetwoallogenic specificities 6-AKRfindO-C3H,wewereonlyableto\ndifferentiate thesewithheterologous antiseraafterexhaustive absorptions (Asakama and\nReif,1968).Itseemsquestionable whether otheralloantigens, suchasthePCalloantigens\nofplasmacells(Takahashi, OldandBoyse,1970),canbedetected withheterologous anti-\nserawithoutsimilarly extensive absorptions. Whilesuchalloantigens possesscharacteristic\norgandistributions, theterm'organ-specific' shouldprobably bereserved forantigens\npresentonlyinasingleorgan,orelseincellsofcloselyrelatedtype.\nTumour-specific transplantation antigens (Gorer,1938;Boyse,Old,Stockert and\nShigeno, 1968;Klein,1969;Watson,Ralph,SarkarandCohn,1970)arerelatively weakly\nimmunogenic onallogenic immunization. Nevertheless, themoredifficultfeatofdemon-\nstrating suchantigens withheterologous antisera hasbeenaccomplished forchronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia (Bentwitch, Cohen,Sulitzeanu, IzakandWeiss,1970).No\nevidence ofspecificity tosuchantigens, nortothespecies-specific antigensT,CandF\n(BoyleandDavies,1966)andMSLA(Shigeno, Hammerling, Arpels,BoyseandOld,\n1968)wasobtained here.\nInthepresentstudy,anantiserum withhighcytolytic potencyagainstleukaemias of\nthreedifferent H-2genotypes wasprepared byimmunization withamixture ofleukaemia\ncells.Previously, aclosecorrelation between theresultsofinvitroimmunecytolysis and\ninvivoantileukaemia therapy hasbeenfound(Mohos andKidd,1957;ReifandKim,\n1969).Therefore, suchanantiserum wouldbeexpected tobeeffective invivo.Finally,\nthepresentdatasuggestthatheteroimmunization withamixtureofleukaemia cellsfrom\ndifferent patientsmightwellresultinantisera withhighinvitropotencies againsthuman\nleukaemias ofdifferent HL-Atypes.1094\nSpecificity ofAntiseraagainstLeukaemias\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CFIXATION ANDIMMUNE CYTOLYSIS\nAninteresting facetofthedataistheapparent contradiction between theconsistently\nlowpotencies ofvarious antisera forimmune cytolysis ofL1210cells(Table1)andthe\nconsistently highpotencies forCfixationbythesamecells(Table2).Thediscrepancies in\nthisconnection weresmallerfortheotherleukaemias. Howcanthesedatabeexplained?\nRecentworkonimmune lysisoferythrocytes orleukaemia cellssuggests thatafter\nattachment toantigensitesonthecellsurface, twomolecules oftheusualtypeofyG\n(BorsosandRapp,1965a),asinglemolecule ofyM(BorsosandRapp,1965b), orasingle\nmolecule ofanunusual typeofyG(FrankandGaither, 1970)areabletofixthefirst\ncomponent ofcomplement, C1.Toexplainwhytheefficiency ofC1forhaemolysis of\nyM-sensitized sheeperythrocytes decreases dramatically asthedensity ofantigen sites\ndecreases (Linscott, 1970),itissuggested thattwositesofantibody attachment tothecell\n~~~~ ~~C complex\n,YGAntibody\na\nFIG.1.Amolecular modelofimmune cytolysis.

However, fixation ofC1tocell-\nboundmolecules ofantibodies doesnotguarantee eitherbinding oftheremaining Ccom-\nponents orsufficient damage ofthemembrane tolysethecell(Linscott, 1970).Theeffi-1095\n1096 A.E.ReifandChung-Ai H.Kim\nciencyofthislatterstepis30-50percentwithyG-sensitized sheeperythrocytes (Rappand\nBorsos,1966),butonlyabout0*03percentwithyM-sensitized mouseleukaemia cells\n(Borsos,Colten,Spalter, Rogentine, andRapp,1968),a1000-fold difference. Toexplain\nthesedataaswellasourown,itissuggested thatimmune lysiscanoccuronlywhenthe\nantibody-bound complement complex iscorrectly oriented foroptimal (andpresumably\nclose)contactwiththecellsurface.Theillustration ofthis(Fig.1)hasbeenarranged tofit\ncurrentconcepts onthestructure ofantibody molecules (Svehag, Chesebro andBloth,\n1967;Green,1969)andtheattachment ofC1totheFcportionofyGoryMantibodies\n(Weiser, MyrvikandPearsall, 1969).\nAccording totheaboveexplanation, thepresentanomalous datawithL1210wouldbe\nexplicable onthebasisofalowersurfaceantigenconcentration onL1210cellsrelativeto\nothermouseleukaemias: sufficient L1210antigensiteswouldbeavailable tofix50per\ncentofthesmallquantity ofCaddedintheCfixationtest(especially since10timesmore\ncellswereusedthaninthecytolysis assay),butwouldbeinsufficient toprovide asready\nimmune cytolysis, withitsmorestringent requirement forclosely-spaced antigensites.\nSincedifferent celltypespossesswidelydifferent sensitivites tonon-immune lysis,implying\ndifferences inthestrength ofdifferent cellsurfaces(ReifandAllen,1966),thesensitivities\ntoimmune lysismayalsodependonthisphysical characteristic.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThisworkwassupported byPublicHealthServiceResearch GrantNo.CA-04469 AI\nfromtheNational CancerInstitute.\nREFERENCES\nAsAKumA, R.andREnT,A.E.(1968).'Thespecificity\nofantilymphocyte seratothymic, splenic, and\nleukemic lymphocytes.'

However, chemotherapy resistance remains a major problem for specific \nsubsets of acute leukaemias. Here, we propose that a molecularly distinct subtype of acute \nleukaemia with shared myeloid and T cell lymphoblastic features, which we term acute myeloid/T-\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (AMTL), is divided across 3 diagnostic categories owing to variable \nexpression of markers deemed to be defining of myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages, such as \nmyeloperoxidase and CD3. This proposed diagnostic group is supported by i) retained myeloid \ndifferentiation potential during early T cell lymphoid development, ii) recognition that some cases \nof acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) harbour hallmarks of T cell development, such as T-cell \nreceptor gene rearrangements and iii) common gene mutations in subsets of AML and T cell acute \nlymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), including WT1, PHF6, RUNX1  and BCL11B . This proposed \ndiagnostic entity overlaps with early T cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL and T cell/myeloid mixed \nphenotype acute leukaemias (MPALs), and also includes a subset of leukaemias currently \nclassified as AML with features of T-lymphoblastic development. The proposed classification of \nAMTL as a distinct entity would enable more precise prospective diagnosis and permit the \ndevelopment of improved therapies for patients whose treatment is inadequate with current \napproaches.\nKeywords\nacute leukaemia; classifications; AML; ALL\n*Correspondence to: Professor Alex Kentsis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan Kettering Institute, 1275 York Ave, Box \n223, New York, NY 10065-6007, USA, Tel: 1-646-888-2593, kentsisresearchgroup@gmail.com And Dr. Alejandro Gutierrez, \nDivision of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. \nalejandro.gutierrez@childrens.harvard.edu.\nDR.

Improvements in clinical outcomes for patients \nwith acute leukaemias treated with modern chemotherapy regimens have been variable. The \nintroduction of molecularly targeted therapies has had a major impact on a small subset of \ngenetically-defined acute leukaemias. For example, arsenic trioxide and retinoic acid, which \ntarget the PML-RARA fusion oncoprotein via distinct mechanisms ( de The, 2015 ), can now \ncure the majority of patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia without exposure to \ncytotoxic chemotherapies ( Lo-Coco et al, 2013 ). However, clinical outcomes for a \nsubstantial fraction of acute leukaemias have seen little improvement despite the application \nof treatment regimens that are among the most intensive and toxic used for any disease. \nConsequently, improving clinical outcomes for these patients will require linking an \nimproved molecular understanding to the application of effective targeted therapies.\nClassification of acute leukaemias\nAcute leukaemias have traditionally been classified based on the normal cell types most \nclosely resembling the leukaemic cell population. Lymphoblastic leukaemias are those with \nevidence of differentiation arrest at immature stages of B- or T-cell lymphoid development, \nwhereas acute myeloid leukaemias encompass malignancies with immunophenotypic \nfeatures that lie along a broad spectrum of haematopoietic progenitors, ranging from \nminimally differentiated leukaemias to those with evidence of granulocytic, monocytic, \nerythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation. Although this classification scheme is intuitive, \nlineage assignment is complicated by the high frequency of aberrant differentiation states in \nacute leukaemias. Indeed, the simultaneous expression of markers that are not known to be \nco-expressed in any normal haematopoietic progenitor is common. To address the \nrequirement for consistent diagnostic criteria for the successful performance and \ninterpretation of clinical trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) has devised a \nclassification scheme that allows most acute leukaemias to be unambiguously classified as \nspecific diagnostic entities, which has been regularly revised ( Swerdlow et al 2008 ; Arber et \nal, 2016 ).\nThe genetics of leukaemia are beginning to be incorporated into the WHO classification, \nwith increasing weight being given to specific chromosomal translocations and, in some \ncases, somatic gene mutations, as disease-defining genetic lesions ( Arber et al, 2016 ). Thus, \nthe presence of a characteristic genetic feature can define a disease, independent of the \nphenotypic lineage which can be difficult to assign in practice. For example, leukaemias \nwith FGFR1  translocations that can present with T cell lymphoblastic or myeloid markers \nare defined as a single diagnostic entity, regardless of the immunophenotype of the \npresenting leukaemic cells ( Arber et al, 2016 ; Macdonald et al, 2002 ). Similarly, acute \nmyeloid leukaemia (AML) cases with t(8;21) translocations exhibit aberrant expression of \nCD19, a marker typically associated with B cell lymphoid malignancies, due to lineage-\ninappropriate PAX5 expression induced by the RUNX1-RUNX1T1  (previously termed \nAML1-ETO ) oncogene ( Walter et al, 2010 ). While we anticipate that genomic classification \nwill have an increasingly important role in defining leukaemia subsets in the future, the Gutierrez and Kentsis Page 2\nBr J Haematol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 March 01.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\ncurrent diagnostic classification for most acute leukaemias does not rely on genetic \nmutations. Thus, phenotypic lineage assignment remains a central component of diagnostic \nclassification and treatment assignment for most patients with acute leukaemia.\nThe current WHO classification considers strong expression of a small number of \nimmunophenotypic markers to be lineage-assigning: myeloperoxidase (MPO) or at least two \nmonocytic markers (CD11c, CD14, CD64 or lysozyme) for myeloid lineage; surface or \ncytoplasmic CD3 expression for T cell lineage; and CD19 with at least one additional B cell \nmarker (CD79a, cytoplasmic CD22, or CD10) for B cell lineage ( Arber et al, 2016 ). While \nthe specificity of these markers is widely agreed upon, some prominent clinical trials groups \nuse subtly different criteria for lineage assignment ( Dworzak et al, 2017 ). Nevertheless, it is \nrecognized that these classification schemes are imperfect, and the strict application of the \nWHO criteria for lineage assignment is not required to make a diagnosis of AML, T cell \nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) or B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) \nunless a diagnosis of mixed phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL) is also being considered \n(Arber et al, 2016 ). Thus, while MPALs that meet formal criteria for assignment to two \ndistinct lineages are very rare, leukaemias classified as AML, T-ALL or B-ALL based on \ntheir predominant morphology and immunophenotype commonly co-express markers that \nindicate aberrant differentiation towards another lineage.\nAcute myeloid/T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (AMTL): Acute leukaemias with \nshared T cell lymphoid and myeloid features\nThe classical model of haematopoiesis postulates an early binary split between common \nmyeloid and lymphoid progenitors that subsequently give rise to both B- and T-cell \nlymphocytes. However, more recent work using clonal tracking assays has shown the \nexistence of progenitors that retain T cell/myeloid or B cell/myeloid bi-lineage potential. By \ncontrast, individual progenitors whose potential is restricted to T cell and B cell (but not \nmyeloid) lineages have been difficult to identify ( Kawamoto et al, 2010 ). These findings fit \nthe clinical observation that MPALs most commonly present with B cell/myeloid or T cell/\nmyeloid marker co-expression, whereas B/T cell MPALs are very rare ( Matutes et al, 2011 ).\nHere, we propose AMTL as a molecularly distinct subtype of acute leukaemias associated \nwith shared T cell lymphoid and myeloid features. Expression of markers deemed to be \ndefining of the myeloid and T cell lymphoid lineages, including myeloperoxidase and CD3, \nis variable in this disease, resulting in its separation across three diagnostic categories in the \ncurrent WHO classification scheme: early T cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL, T/myeloid MPAL, \nand a specific subset of AML harbouring hallmarks of T-lymphoblastic differentiation.\nThis proposed diagnostic entity overlaps with subsets of ETP T-ALL, which is characterized \nby differentiation arrest at early stages of T cell development. While a number of biomarkers \nhave been described to identify these cases ( Coustan-Smith et al, 2009 ; Gutierrez et al, 2010 ; \nHomminga et al, 2011 ; Zuurbier et al, 2014 ), these are most commonly defined clinically \nusing an immunophenotypic classifier that includes absent expression of CD1a and CD8, \nCD5 expression that is substantially lower than that of normal peripheral blood T cells, and \nthe presence of one or more markers of myeloid or haematopoietic progenitors (CD117, Gutierrez and Kentsis Page 3\nBr J Haematol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 March 01.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nCD34, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD11b or CD65) ( Conter et al, 2016 ; Coustan-Smith et al, \n2009 ; Patrick et al, 2014 ). Currently, ETP is classified as a subtype of T-ALL due to the \nexpression of CD3, but has a genetic mutational profile that is similar to those observed in \nmyeloid malignancies, such as AML, whereas mutations characteristic of other subtypes of \nT-ALL, such as CDKN2A  deletions, are less common ( Gutierrez et al, 2010 ; Van \nVlierberghe et al, 2011a ; Zhang et al, 2012 ).\nWhile similarities between ETP T-ALL and AML have been previously recognized ( Van \nVlierberghe et al, 2011a ; Zhang et al, 2012 ; Zuurbier et al, 2014 ), we propose that the \nbiological overlap of AMTL is not with AML per se , but with a specific subset of AML \ncases that also exhibit T cell lymphoid features. Namely, a subset of AMLs has long been \nrecognized to harbour clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulin (Ig) gene \nrearrangements, indicating activity of the RAG recombinase that is responsible for \ngenerating somatic V(D)J recombination at these loci at specific stages of lymphoid \ndevelopment ( Norton et al, 1987 ; Parreira et al, 1992 ; Schmidt et al, 1992 ). These AML \ncases can also express the lymphoid marker terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT, also \nknown as DNTT), which generates diversity at the TCR and Ig genes by mutating the \njunctions of rearrangements during V(D)J recombination ( Drexler et al, 1993 ; Patel et al, \n2013 ). Non-megakaryoblastic AMLs with TCR rearrangements typically co-express \nphenotypic markers of T-lymphoblastic differentiation, such as CD7, CD2 and CD4 \n(Schmidt et al, 1992 ). We postulate that this is the subset of AMLs that also harbour \nmutations that are commonly observed in a distinct subset of T-ALL, including WT1, PHF6, \nRUNX1  and BCL11B  (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013 ; Della Gatta et \nal, 2012 ; Ding et al, 2012 ; Klco et al, 2015 ; Tosello et al, 2009 ; Van Vlierberghe et al, 2010 ; \nVan Vlierberghe et al, 2011b ; Zhang et al, 2012 ). Thus, a similar group of acute leukaemias \nexhibit shared features of myeloid and T cell lymphoid differentiation, and shared genetic \nmutations, which will need to be formally assessed in future studies.\nPotential mechanisms for combined T-lymphoblastic and myeloid \ndifferentiation in acute leukaemia\nAt least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms can explain the development of acute \nleukaemias with differentiation potential shared with myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages:\n1. Transformation of normal haematopoietic progenitors with T-lymphoblastic and \nmyeloid bi-lineage potential.  While studies of endogenous haematopoiesis have \nrevealed limited evidence of a putative normal progenitor whose fate is restricted \nto T-lymphoid and myeloid lineages, the identification of such a progenitor may \nhave been hindered by differences in the lifespan of mature myeloid versus T-\nlymphoid cells. Nevertheless, even if a normal progenitor whose differentiation \nfate is restricted to T-lymphocytes and myeloid cells is lacking, such leukaemias \ncan arise from cells that retain multi-lineage potential, even though their fate is \nnormally restricted to a single lineage by microenvironmental signals. Immature \nintrathymic T cell progenitors at early double-negative stages of differentiation \nrepresent one potential cell of origin for such leukaemias. Indeed, the most \nimmature intrathymic T cell progenitors retain myeloid (but not B-lymphoid) Gutierrez and Kentsis Page 4\nBr J Haematol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 March 01.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\npotential until they progress through a BCL11B-dependent commitment to the T \ncell lineage ( Balciunaite et al, 2005 ; Ikawa et al, 2010 ; Li et al, 2010 ) (Figure 1). \nFurther, lineage tracing studies have demonstrated that immature T cell \nprogenitors give rise to some macrophages and neutrophils harbouring TCR gene \nrearrangements in vivo  (Bell & Bhandoola, 2008 ; Wada et al, 2008 ). Ectopic \nexpression of Myc and Bcl2  in mouse early double-negative T cell progenitors \ncan drive development of acute leukaemias with variable expression of markers \nof myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages ( Riemke et al, 2016 ), demonstrating that \nearly T cell progenitors can function as the potential cell of origin of AMTL.\n2. Induction of aberrant trans-differentiation by leukemogenic mutations.  It is now \nestablished that specific gene mutations can induce T cell lymphoid or myeloid \ndifferentiation. For example, activation of NOTCH1 signalling in mouse bone \nmarrow cells causes aberrant T cell differentiation independent of thymic \nmicroenvironmental signals ( Pui et al, 1999 ). Likewise, mutations inactivating \nRunx1  in haematopoietic progenitors cause, aberrant myeloid differentiation \n(Goyama et al, 2013 ). Thus, aberrant trans-differentiation of AMTL cells can in \nprinciple, occur as a result of combinations of mutations that cooperatively result \nin combined myeloid and T-lymphoid lineage commitment with differentiation \narrest (Figure 1). These mutations include genes encoding regulators of \nchromatin and DNA remodelling, and transcription factors with key functions in \ncontrolling lymphoid and myeloid cell fate specification. Future studies using \nemerging approaches for combinatorial gene editing and conditional gene \nmanipulation in vivo  may reveal how the specific combinations of mutations in \nspecific cell progenitor populations cooperate to induce AMTL and other non-\ncanonical leukaemia subtypes.\nIdentification of Acute Myeloid/T-Lymphoblastic Leukaemia\nTo a first approximation, AMTL can be defined as acute leukaemias that fit the diagnostic \ncriteria of ETP T-ALL or of T/myeloid MPALs, together with AMLs with clonal TCR gene \nrearrangements and evidence of T-lymphoid differentiation (CD3, CD7, CD2 or CD4 \nexpression). However, we note that aberrant expression of CD4 and CD7 is relatively \ncommon in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL), a subtype of AML that is \nmolecularly distinct from AMTL ( de Rooij et al, 2017 ). Therefore, AMKL should be \nexcluded from the definition of AMTL, based on absence of megakaryblastic morphology \nand expression of the platelet markers CD41 or CD61. Thus, our initial proposal for AMTL \nas a diagnostic entity includes all cases currently classified as ETP T-ALL and T/myeloid \nMPALs, together with the subset of AMLs with TCR rearrangements and expression of T-\nlymphoblastic markers.\nGiven the variability in cell surface marker expression in acute leukaemias, we propose that \nclinical genomic profiling will enhance the classification of AMTL as a specific diagnostic \nentity. Indeed, ETP T-ALLs harbour mutations of several genes that are commonly mutated \nin myeloid neoplasms, such as RAS  family members, ETV6 , MEF2C  and EZH2 , but whose \nmutations are rare in other T-ALL subtypes, ( Homminga et al, 2011 ; Van Vlierberghe et al, Gutierrez and Kentsis Page 5\nBr J Haematol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 March 01.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n2011a ; Zhang et al, 2012 ; Zuurbier et al, 2014 ). We also suggest that the subset of AML \ncases harbouring clonal TCR gene rearrangements should demonstrate substantial overlap \nwith those AML cases harbouring mutations that are common in T-ALL, such as WT1, \nRUNX1, PHF6  and BCL11B  (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013 ; Ding et \nal, 2012 ; Klco et al, 2015 ; Zhang et al, 2012 ). We anticipate that future investigation will \nlead to an improved classifier of AMTL based on both immunophenotypic and genetic \ndiagnostic markers.\nConclusions\nWe propose acute myeloid/T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (AMTL) as a new diagnostic entity \nfor acute leukaemias with shared myeloid and T cell lymphoblastic features. Defining the \ndetailed molecular mechanisms of aberrant cell differentiation may lead to the development \nof improved therapies by targeting specific molecular dependencies in these cells. For \nexample, mutant transcription factors function in the context of corepressor and coactivator \ncomplexes, which have specific enzymatic functions, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) \ninhibitors ( Haberland et al, 2009 ). Isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors are beginning to be \ndeveloped ( West & Johnstone, 2014 ), and specific inhibitors may warrant therapeutic \ninvestigation in AMTL with dysregulation of MEF2 family members, for example. \nLikewise, specific mutations may engender synthetic lethal dependencies, such as, for \nexample, inhibition of the EZH2 methyltransferase in cases of cancers with mutations of \ngenes encoding components of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable/BRG1-associated \nfactors (SWI/SNF/BAF) chromatin remodelling complex ( Kim et al, 2015 ). Recently, \nacetyltranferase inhibitors have been found to have therapeutic efficacy in CBP-deficient \nlymphomas ( Ogiwara et al, 2016 ). Finally, many leukaemias exhibit aberrant resistance to \nmitochondrial apoptosis, conferring resistance to intensive combination chemotherapies, \nsuch as those used for treatment of refractory AML and T-ALL. Recent data suggest that \nAMTLs are particularly susceptible to inhibitors of BCL2 ( Chonghaile et al, 2014 ; Pan et al, \n2014 ), and emerging inhibitors of other regulators of intrinsic apoptosis are expected to offer \nuseful therapeutic strategies for AMTL patients as well.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Misha Roshal, Mark Fleming, and Peter Steinherz for helpful discussions.

A total of twenty patients with acute leukaemias having undergone HSCT were selected and assessed for \nthe analysis of chimerism status. DNA extraction from the whole blood was done by chelex method and short tandem repeats were amplified by using conventional STR- PCR assay. Electrophoresis was carried out and 6% polyacrylamide \ngels were used for the resultant amplified DNA products and then followed by their densitometry. These patients \nhad undergone HSCT from Pakistan Institute of Medical Science and Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre.  \nResults: The peaks in the PAGE densitometry represented the donor chimerism in all post transplant samples of the \npatients. Conclusion: Our study showed that densitometry of STR PCR PAGE is a useful and cheaper method for demonstration \nof donor chimerism in acute leukaemia patients having undergone HSCT. Hence this method can be a valuable option in the monitoring of chimerism status in these patients and therefore helps in preventing graft failure by fast and early treatment strategies for these patients.\nKEYWORDS: DC, STR, PCR, PAGE, Densitometry, Informative allele.\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.40.5.9216\nHow to cite this: Nayyar A, Ahmed S.

The Twenty post-\ntransplant samples of the patients with acute leukaemias who had their stem cell transplanr were studied. About \n3-ml of peripheral blood was taken in EDTA container. \nDNA was extracted using Chelex\nTM method.11 To flank \nthe repeat units in the gene regions, specific STR primers were designed and PCR conditions for STR were same \nas described by Ahmed.\n11 Each sibling pair (donor and \nrecipient) were first run at ten different autosomal STR \nloci (Table-I). The informative locus was identified \ni.e. donor and recipient had at least one exclusive \nallele. The donor and the recipient post-transplant samples were run for the informative STR locus. The STR amplified products were analysed on 10 X 20 cm \npolyacrylamide gels (PAGE) after silver staining. The \nresults of PAGE results were photographed and were analysed by a software image analysis (http://thal-it.com). The donor Chimerism was then calculated and demonstrated as percent of complete donor Chimerism.\nEthical Approval: The study was approved by the \ninstitutional ethical review board, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Riphah International University Islamabad-Pakistan (Ref. # Riphah/IIMC/IRC/23/3036). RESULTS\nInformative STR loci in the Donor/Recipient pairs \n(sibling pairs): All the twenty sibling pairs when \nanalyzed by STR-PCR showed that at least one informative STR locus was found in every pair (Table-I). The informative STR loci were divided into “Common”, “Uncommon” loci and “rare”. In each donor/recipient pair the number of informative loci varied from 1 to 8. The usefulness of each STR locus, \nFig.1: Silver stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of STR PCR at D5S818 locus. Lane 1 shows two distinct alleles in the recipient pre-transplant sample. Lane 2 shows two alleles of the same size (homozygous) appearing as a single thick band in the donor sample. Lane 3 shows the recipient post-transplant sample with two alleles but the intensity of the shorter allele (lower band) is significantly less than the larger allele (upper band). The reap-pearance of the recipient specific allele (lower band) indicates a reappearance of the recipient’s tissue (decreasing chimerism).\nFig.1.1: Densitometric evaluation of the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the recipient’s post-transplant sample shown in the figure 1. Peak 2 (39.4%) is the recipient specific allele and its reappearance indicates a reappearance of the recipient’s tissue (decreasing chimerism).

Densitometric evaluation of the polyacrylamide gel of STR-PCR was done later on. (Fig.1 to Fig.2.2). The densitometric evaluation of PAGE clearly showed donor chimerism in post transplant samples of the patients in regards to their percentages estimated. The overall results of the 20 sibling pairs and the level of chimerism in these pairs ranged from 13.2% to 98.9%.Donor Chimerism by STR-PCR: Results of donor chi-merism by STR PCR in the 20 sibling pairs were read from the silver-stained polyacrylamide gels and their densitometry.\nDISCUSSION\n Currently Haematopoietic stem cell transplant is \nconsidered to be an effective and efficient therapeutic strategy for managing different hematologic malignancies, but alongwith is compounded by  various complications, such as disease recurrence, toxicity related to treatment related toxicity, Graft rejection and GVHD.\n13 The main cause of failure of haematopoietic \nstem cell transplant is relapse inspite of continuous improvement in this therapeutic modality especially in patients with acute leukemia. As recommended by EuroChimerism consortium PCR analysis of STR is the standard method for estimation of quantitative chimerism in the prediction of relapses.\n14 Regarding routine chimerism monitoring there are \npromising investigations on the new methods; however, for monitoring of chimerism status currently STR-PCR is the established method which not only determines the type of chimeras, but also determines the percentage of both donor and recipient cells.\n8 Hence after HSCT \nreappearance or persistence of recipient cells can indicate the recurrence of the recipient’s hematopoietic cells or presence of malignant cells or both.\n15 Many \nresearchers have proved that the PCR analysis of short tandem repeat profiles of DNA sequences and single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis with real-time quantitative PCR based methods are major techniques used for detection of chimerism.\n12,16 The STRs have an \nadvantage over other molecular markers for estimating the chimerism because of increase number of allels and low amount of DNA required in a PCR reaction.\n17 The \ndetection limit of STR-PCR for recipient chimerism is  ranging from 1 to 10% in few studies. Although technical variability among laboratories may be noticeable.\n18,19\n Few researchers found out that by using STR markers \nin 56 children with ALL after HSCT early detection of chimerism can be found out easily.\n20 Hence for analysis \nof chimerism, the preferred technique should be easy to perform, rapid, cheap, easily interpretable and applicable to every patient. In addition, results should have less variation between the samples and should be highly reproducible.  However these consideration should be taken into account for analyzing the exact quantification of donor/recipient DNA for assessing engraftment of the donor DNA and diagnosing the failure of graft  in an early manner.\n4\n In a study by Andrikovics et al a total of 12 STR \nmarkers are needed to obtain 95% informativity for the analysis of chimerism.\n21 A group of researchers in \nFig.2: Silver stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of STR PCR at D3S1358 locus. Lane 1 shows two closely packed alleles in the recipient pre-transplant sample. Lane 2 shows two distinct alleles in the donor sample. Lanes 3 & 4 show the recipient post-transplant samples with three alleles. The middle allele (indicated by arrow) is the recipient’s exclusive allele. Its reappearance in the post-transplant sample indicates a reappearance of the recipient’s tissue (decreasing chimerism).\nFig.2.2: Densitometric evaluation of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the recipient’s post-transplant sample shown in the figure 2. Peak 2 (20.6%) is the recipient specific allele and its reappearance in a post-transplant sample indicates a reappearance of the recipient’s tissue (decreasing chimerism). The donor chimerism in this case was reported as 79.4% (79.4% donor component and 20.6% recipient component).Ayesha Nayyar et al.\nPak J Med Sci     May - June  2024    Vol. 40   No. 5      www.pjms.org.pk     878their study of 230 patients of malignant hematological \ndisorders found out that five STR informative markers were able to find chimerism in all patients except ten patients who deceased and also suggested that STR is more informative in detecting mixed chimerism as compared to other method.\n22 A Japanese study \nsuggested that using 20 STR markers and the KMR kit markers the informativity in donor/recipient pairs for estimation of chimerism may be detected in a large variety of donor/recipient pairs.\n23 \n Few researchers have suggested that at least 40 \nmarkers are required to discriminate a large number of the donor recipient pairs. \n24 A group of researchers \nin their study have observed the status of chimerism \nby using STR markers in 39 donor/recipient pairs and \nfound chimerism in all the pairs.25  \nCONCLUSION\n Our study demonstrates that STR -PCR using \ndensitometric evaluation is a simple and favourable technique without use of any special instrumentation and expensive reagents making it suitable for a use in routine laboratory practices. Hopefully this will help in analysis of the outcomes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients suffering from acute leukaemias.\nConflict of Interest:  None.\nFinancial support or Grant: None.\nREFERENCES\n1.
