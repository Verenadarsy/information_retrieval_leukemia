We have studied the role\nof the Mll–AF9 gene fusion made in mouse embryonic\nstem cells by an homologous recombination knock-\nin. Acute leukaemias developed in heterozygous mice\ncarrying this fusion as well as in chimeric mice. As\nwith human chromosomal translocation t(9;11), the\nmajority of cases were acute myeloid leukaemias\ninvolving immature myeloblasts, but a\n(AMLs)\nminority were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The\nAMLs were preceded by effects on haematopoietic\ndifferentiation involving a myeloproliferation resulting\nin accumulation of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive mature\nmyeloid cells in bone marrow as early as 6 days after\nbirth. Therefore, non-malignant expansion of myeloid\nprecursors is the ﬁrst stage of Mll–AF9-mediated leuk-\naemia followed by accumulation of malignant cells in\nbone marrow and other tissues. Thus, the late onset of\novert tumours suggests that secondary tumorigenic\nmutations are necessary for malignancy associated with\nMLL–AF9 gene fusion and that myeloproliferation\nprovides the pool of cells in which such events can occur.\nKeywords: ALL-1/chromosomal translocations/\nhaematopoiesis/HRX/leukaemia",

There is a strong correlation between the leukaemia\nphenotype and each of these speciﬁc MLL translocation\nfusions (Corral et al., 1993; Thirman et al., 1993). The\ntranslocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) is mainly associated with\nAMLs (Iida et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993) while\nthe translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) is found predominantly\nin ALLs (Gu et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993; Iida et al.,\n1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993;\nDowning et al., 1994). The t(11;19)(p13;q23) translocation\non the other hand occurs in both ALL and AML but\nwith higher frequency in ALL (Nakamura et al., 1993;\nYamamoto et al., 1993; Rubnitz et al., 1996a). These\nﬁndings suggest that the incoming fusion partner of MLL\nhelps to specify the cell type of the tumour. Thus, the\nfusion protein itself may inﬂuence tumour type if the\nchromosomal translocation occurs in a pluripotent pre-\ncursor cell. It is nonetheless possible that the chromosomal\ntranslocation may occur in a committed precursor because\nthe chromosomal region is accessible for the chromosomal\ntranslocation event, in which case the protein fusion would\nnot strictly specify tumour type. Several biological models\nhave been established to gain insights into the role of the\nMLL fusions in tumorigenesis. The use of retroviruses\nencoding the MLL/HRX–ENL fusion to infect primitive\ncells showed that myeloid cell proliferation could be\nobserved and that tumours of this lineage emerged (Lavau\net al., 1997; Slany et al., 1997). These experiments suggest\nthat a gain-of-function mechanism at least partly explains\nthe role of this fusion protein which is made after the\nchromosomal translocation t(11;19) in humans. The fusion\nof the AF9 gene with the Mll gene also resulted in the\nemergence of AML in mice (Corral et al., 1996).",

The propensity of the MLL gene to form\nfusion genes after chromosomal translocations is important\nbecause (cid:46)15% of all acute leukaemias in man have MLL\ngene fusions and because there is an association of\nparticular MLL fusions with particular subtypes of acute\nleukaemia. For instance, MLL–AF4/FEL fusions are typic-\nally found in lymphoblastic tumours, whereas MLL–AF9\nfusions are typically found in myeloid tumours (Djabali\net al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; Domer et al., 1993; Iida\net al., 1993; Morrissey et al., 1993; Nakamura et al.,\n1993). This implies a speciﬁc role for the chimeric protein\nin determination of the type of leukaemia which develops.\nNonetheless, an alternative possibility is based purely on\nmechanism and accessibility of genes in chromosomes.\nThus the ability of MLL and AF9 or MLL and AF4\ngenomic regions to take part in an inter-chromosomal\ntranslocation may be greater in committed myeloid or\nlymphoid cells, respectively. The alternative models can\nbe assessed using animal models of disease in which gene\nfusion is either controlled by speciﬁc interchromosomal\nevents (Smith et al., 1995; van Deursen et al., 1995) or\nby knock-in of the fusion gene partner (Thomas and\nCapecchi, 1987; Corral et al., 1996). We have developed\nand analysed a model for MLL–AF9-induced leukaemia\nusing homologous recombination to knock-in the AF9 into\nthe endogenous mouse Mll gene (Corral et al., 1996).

Nearly all these rearrangements affect the ALL-1 gene, also\ntermed MLL1, HRX and HTRX, located at 11q23. The transloca-\ntions occur within an 8.3 kb breakpoint cluster region of the gene\nand result in the replacement of ALL-1-coding sequence 3’ to the\nbreakpoint by the coding sequence of the translocation partner\n(Gu et al, 1992; Tkachuk et al, 1992). In a second and less frequent\ntype of rearrangement, ALL-1 undergoes partial tandem duplica-\ntion (self-fusion), resulting in the production of a larger protein\n(Schichman et al, 1995). The most common ALL-1 translocations\nare t(4; 11), t(9; 11), t(11; 19), t(6; 11) and t(10; 11), accounting for\n40, 27, 12, 5 and 5% of cases, respectively.

They\npredominate infant acute leukaemia (80% of ALL and 65% of\nAML), and account for the majority of therapy-related (secondary)\nleukaemias developing in 5 – 15% of primary cancer patients who\nhad received intensive chemotherapy, including epipodophyllo-\ntoxins (VP16) and anthracyclines (doxorubicin) (Pui and Relling,\n2000). These drugs are inhibitors of topoisomerase II, and act by\nstabilising double-strand DNA breaks generated by this enzyme. In\nthe latency period is\nboth infant and secondary leukaemias,\nremarkably brief.

    "paragraph": "Two methodologies have been used to generate mouse models of\nALL-1 leukaemogenesis. Knockin of the partner gene AF9 into the\nALL-1 locus by homologous recombination resulted in animals\nthat developed AML at approximately 6 months (Dobson et al,\n1999). Transmission of the transgene in the germ line and its\nexpression during embryogenesis resulted in viable progeny. This,\ntogether with the observation that mice carrying a single null allele\nof ALL-1 were not predisposed to AML (Corral et al, 1996), rules\nout a model of leukaemogenesis due to haploinsufficiency (passive\nloss of function). Rather, an extensive series of investigations\napplying retro viral transduction into cultured haematopoietic\nfollowed by transplantation into mice, have\nprogenitor cells,\nestablished that ALL-1 fusion genes act as dominant alleles and the\ndisease is due to ALL-1 gain of function. Structure – function\nanalysis of several ALL-1 fusion proteins showed that particular\nelements within the partner proteins, such as transcription effector\ndomains and protein – protein interaction motifs, are critical for\nthe leukaemogenic activity (reviewed in Ayton and Cleary, 2001).\nThe presence of dimerisation domains in some of the partner\nproteins, such as AF6, AF10, AF17, AF1p, GAS7 and AF3p21\nsuggested that self-association might underlie the role of the\npartner proteins with such motifs in the leukaemogenicity of ALL-\n1 fusion proteins. The most compelling experimental evidence for\nthis is that homodimerisation of ALL-1 by synthetic dimerisation\nmodules mimics many of the features of ALL-1 fusion proteins\n(Dobson et al, 2000; So et al, 2003b, Martin et al, 2003). Also,\ndisruption of the dimerisation motifs in some partner proteins\neliminated pathogenicity. Although self-dimerisation appears to\nplay a key role in leukaemogenesis associated with partner\nproteins containing a dimerisation motif,\nthe most common\nfusions – ALL-1/AF4, ALL-1/AF9 and ALL-1/ENL – do not dimerise.\nBoth the knockin and retroviral transduction approaches turned\nout to be biased towards myeloid leukaemia. However, very recent\nstudies with virally transduced ALL1-ENL (Zeisig et al, 2003) and\nALL1-GAS7 (So et al, 2003a) showed transformation of bipheno-\ntypic lymphoid/myeloid cells and induction of biphenotypic\nleukaemia. So et al serially plated the transduced bone marrows\nin methylcellulose and found that the fusion protein conferred\nlong-term growth capacity to multipotential progenitors. The\nprogenitors spontaneously differentiated into biphenotypic and\nmyeloid progenitors during culturing in vitro. Moreover, mice\ninjected with the transduced serially-plated progenitors developed\neither biphenotypic leukaemia, or AML or ALL. On the basis of\nthese experiments, it was proposed that ALL-1 fusion proteins\nenhance the self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors that\nretain an ability to differentiate into downstream progeny. The\nlatter are more susceptible to differentiation blocking by ALL-1\nfusion proteins, or are prone to secondary mutations required for\nfull malignant transformation.",

In this age group, the recorded\nincidence rate increased from 4.89 per 100 000 person -years in 1953 -57 to 7.92 in 1988 -90. During 1973 -77\nto 1988-90 (and probably in earlier years), the increase was due to an increase in acute lymphoblastic\nleukaemia (ALL). The trends were unlikely to be due to changes in diagnosis or case ascertainment. The\nchildhood leukaemia trends might be related to trends in family size, maternal age, socioeconomic level or\nexposure to infections. However, there are uncertainties about the importance of these factors or about their\ntrends. The incidence of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) decreased between 1968-72 and 1988-\n90. The time trends highlight the likely importance of environmental factors in the aetiology of childhood\nleukaemias in New Zealand. The risk of ALL was lower in the Maori than in the non-Maori population\n(relative risk Maori/non-Maori 0.74). The risk of ANLL was higher among Maori (relative risk 1.84).",

The\ns.c. route of inoculation was chosen be-\ncause it induced smaller tumours which\nregressed more rapidly, so that survival\nwas greater, though the immunity in-\nduced was as strong as with the i.m. route.\nMoreover, the long-term pathogenicity\nresponsible for recurrences of sarcoma in\nsites different from the first inoculation\n(diaphragm, spleen, liver) was also sig-\nnificantly reduced. The explanation may\nbe that in the s.c. region there is less\nmuscular tissue available for the replica-\ntion of the virus with special tropism for\nthis tissue. The effectiveness of the experi-\nmental protocol using MSV-M as a live\nvaccine\nfor immunoprevention studies\nwas confirmed in the first group of experi-\nments in which immunized mice were\nchallenged with FLV, RLV7 and MLV, also\nused in other laboratories for immuno-\nprevention assays. Extension of the ex-\nperiments to\nother leukaemia\nviruses\noriginating\nour laboratory showed\nin\neffective protection against primary leuk-\naemias induced by PLLV and HI 79A/LV.\nHowever, although serological data (Fefer,\n1967) and in immunization with MSV-G\n(Basombrio et al., 1977) have indicated the\npresence of cross-reacting antigens in GLV'\nand MSV-M, no significant\nprotection\nagainst GLV could be detected.",

MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities\nin infant and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)\nand do not normally acquire secondary mutations compared to other leukaemias. To model these\nleukaemias, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9\ngene editing to induce MLL-AF9 (MA9) chromosomal rearrangements in murine hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cell lines and primary cells. By utilizing a dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA)\napproach targeting the breakpoint cluster region of murine Mll and Af9 equivalent to that in human\nMA9 rearrangements, we show eﬃcient de novo generation of MA9 fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels in the bulk population. The leukaemic features of MA9-induced disease were\nobserved including increased clonogenicity, enrichment of c-Kit-positive leukaemic stem cells and\nincreased MA9 target gene expression. This approach provided a rapid and reliable means of de\nnovo generation of Mll-Af9 genetic rearrangements in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor\ncells (HSPCs), using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce a cellular model of MA9 leukaemias which\nfaithfully reproduces many features of the human disease in vitro.",

These properties appear to play a critical role in\nleukaemic transformation [11,12]. Oncogenic properties of MLL fusion proteins include interference\nwith transcriptional elongation, resulting in dysregulation of target genes [13,14]. Aberrant expression\nof MLL target genes is strongly dependent on DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation [15], which is\na critical requirement for MA9 leukaemogensis [16]. Members of the Homeobox (HOX) family are\ncommonly overexpressed in MLLr leukaemias as a direct target of MLL fusion proteins [4,17]. The HOX\nfamily are critical factors in the self-renewing properties of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their\noverexpression results in a diﬀerentiation block and an increase in self-renewal of immature myeloid\nprogenitor cells. The HOX cofactors MEIS1 [18,19] and PBX3 [20] are also direct targets of MLL fusion\nproteins [21] frequently found upregulated in coordination with HOX targets. Importantly, there is\nevidence to suggest that MA9-mediated leukaemia can progress even in the absence of HOX genes\nsuch as HOXA9 [22], indicating an important role of non-HOX family genes. This includes CDK6 [23],\nEVI-1 [24,25] and EYA1 [26,27], which are also found upregulated in MLLr leukaemias as a result of\ndirect binding of MLL-FPG proteins to gene promoters [26,28,29], and play a vital role in leukaemic\ntransformation including cellular immortalization [26], hyperproliferation [23,24], chemoresistance [24]\nand dysregulated self-renewal [25,27].

Retrovirus-mediated expression models however drive transgene expressions that\nare not physiological. To gain greater control over the level of cell-restricted transgene expression,\nDox-inducible transgenic models have since been developed [39,40] enabling close-to-physiological\nlevels and reversible transgene expression in a Dox dose-dependent manner. Using this model, it was\ndemonstrated that long-term HSC (LT-HSC) populations result in an invasive and chemoresistant AML\nwith a primitive progenitor phenotype and a distinct stemness-related gene expression pattern [39].\nDox-inducible transgene expression is however not controlled by an endogenous promoter. “Leaky” Cre\nexpression from tissue-speciﬁc promoters together with the expensive and time-consuming nature of\ntissue-restricted strain generation are major limitations with the Cre-loxP and Dox-inducible transgenic\nmodel systems. More recent attempts to circumvent some of the issues highlighted above have utilized\ntranscription activator like eﬀector nucleases (TALEN) technology to generate endogenous MA9 [41,42].\nThese cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher clonogenic potential with colony morphologies consistent\nwith an immature cell type and development of AML, ALL and MPAL upon xenotransplantation [41].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology facilitates\ncreation of DSBs at almost any genomic sequence of interest technology and has revolutionised the\nway in which we are able to manipulate the genome, aﬀording a more ﬂexible and readily applicable\nmethod for generating novel disease models, including chromosomal translocations, with an ease and\nsimplicity far outweighing prior technologies such as TALEN and Cre-LoxP.

MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities\nin infant and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)\nand do not normally acquire secondary mutations compared to other leukaemias. To model these\nleukaemias, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9\ngene editing to induce MLL-AF9 (MA9) chromosomal rearrangements in murine hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cell lines and primary cells. By utilizing a dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA)\napproach targeting the breakpoint cluster region of murine Mll and Af9 equivalent to that in human\nMA9 rearrangements, we show eﬃcient de novo generation of MA9 fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels in the bulk population. The leukaemic features of MA9-induced disease were\nobserved including increased clonogenicity, enrichment of c-Kit-positive leukaemic stem cells and\nincreased MA9 target gene expression. This approach provided a rapid and reliable means of de\nnovo generation of Mll-Af9 genetic rearrangements in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor\ncells (HSPCs), using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce a cellular model of MA9 leukaemias which\nfaithfully reproduces many features of the human disease in vitro.",

These properties appear to play a critical role in\nleukaemic transformation [11,12]. Oncogenic properties of MLL fusion proteins include interference\nwith transcriptional elongation, resulting in dysregulation of target genes [13,14]. Aberrant expression\nof MLL target genes is strongly dependent on DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation [15], which is\na critical requirement for MA9 leukaemogensis [16]. Members of the Homeobox (HOX) family are\ncommonly overexpressed in MLLr leukaemias as a direct target of MLL fusion proteins [4,17]. The HOX\nfamily are critical factors in the self-renewing properties of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their\noverexpression results in a diﬀerentiation block and an increase in self-renewal of immature myeloid\nprogenitor cells. The HOX cofactors MEIS1 [18,19] and PBX3 [20] are also direct targets of MLL fusion\nproteins [21] frequently found upregulated in coordination with HOX targets. Importantly, there is\nevidence to suggest that MA9-mediated leukaemia can progress even in the absence of HOX genes\nsuch as HOXA9 [22], indicating an important role of non-HOX family genes. This includes CDK6 [23],\nEVI-1 [24,25] and EYA1 [26,27], which are also found upregulated in MLLr leukaemias as a result of\ndirect binding of MLL-FPG proteins to gene promoters [26,28,29], and play a vital role in leukaemic\ntransformation including cellular immortalization [26], hyperproliferation [23,24], chemoresistance [24]\nand dysregulated self-renewal [25,27]. CDK6 speciﬁcally has been highlighted as a critical eﬀector of\nMLLr leukemogenesis as its depletion in mice with MA9-driven AML was shown to overcome the\nmyeloid diﬀerentiation block and to prolong survival in vivo [29].",

These methods beneﬁt from its speed\nand ease of use [36,37] and has led to the identiﬁcation of both the HSC and the granulocyte and\nmacrophage progenitor (GMP) as potential leukaemic stem cells-of-origin with divergent clinical\nfeatures [38]. Retrovirus-mediated expression models however drive transgene expressions that\nare not physiological. To gain greater control over the level of cell-restricted transgene expression,\nDox-inducible transgenic models have since been developed [39,40] enabling close-to-physiological\nlevels and reversible transgene expression in a Dox dose-dependent manner. Using this model, it was\ndemonstrated that long-term HSC (LT-HSC) populations result in an invasive and chemoresistant AML\nwith a primitive progenitor phenotype and a distinct stemness-related gene expression pattern [39].\nDox-inducible transgene expression is however not controlled by an endogenous promoter. “Leaky” Cre\nexpression from tissue-speciﬁc promoters together with the expensive and time-consuming nature of\ntissue-restricted strain generation are major limitations with the Cre-loxP and Dox-inducible transgenic\nmodel systems. More recent attempts to circumvent some of the issues highlighted above have utilized\ntranscription activator like eﬀector nucleases (TALEN) technology to generate endogenous MA9 [41,42].\nThese cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher clonogenic potential with colony morphologies consistent\nwith an immature cell type and development of AML, ALL and MPAL upon xenotransplantation [41].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology facilitates\ncreation of DSBs at almost any genomic sequence of interest technology and has revolutionised the\nway in which we are able to manipulate the genome, aﬀording a more ﬂexible and readily applicable\nmethod for generating novel disease models, including chromosomal translocations, with an ease and\nsimplicity far outweighing prior technologies such as TALEN and Cre-LoxP. CRISPR technology has\nfacilitated generation of chromosomal deletions [43] and rearrangements, including inversions [44] and\ntranslocations [45–48]. Here, we demonstrate eﬃcient CRISPR-mediated generation of an endogenous\nMll-Af9 reciprocal translocation in a murine cell line and primary HSPCs. By utilizing a dual-single\nguide RNA (sgRNA) approach to target the most common breakpoints in human MA9 rearrangements,\nwe show rapid, reliable generation of simultaneous breakpoints and a fusion product at the DNA\nand RNA levels. The resultant transformed cells reliably recapitulated features of human MLLr\nleukaemias. These include increased expression of MA9 target genes, reduced IL3 dependency,\nhigher clonogenic potential and self-renewal in primary murine HSPCs. This multiplexed CRISPR\ntechnology oﬀers a robust and malleable approach for generating murine models of the multitude of\nhuman translocation-associated leukaemias.",

C-Kit expression has also been strongly associated with poor prognoses in\nother instances of chromosomal translocations such as t(8;21) [55]. We saw a signiﬁcant enrichment of\nc-Kit-expressing cells, indicating an enrichment of colony-forming LSC-like early progenitor cells in\nMA9-expressing cells consistent with leukaemic transformation. Assessment of myeloid diﬀerentiation\ndid not reveal a block in expression of diﬀerentiation markers in MA9-mediated cells, indicating that,\nalthough cells have acquired self-renewal properties, they maintain the ability to diﬀerentiate toward the\nmyeloid lineage. A block in terminal myeloid diﬀerentiation cannot be ruled out, and whether cells can\ncomplete myeloid diﬀerentiation remains to be investigated. Cells that are unable to diﬀerentiate to the\nGMP stage of diﬀerentiation in murine models of MLLr do not undergo leukaemic transformation [56],\nand so, it is understood that some level of diﬀerentiation down the myeloid pathway is required for\nMLLr AML transformation. Data produced by Stavropoulou et al. utilizing a Dox-inducible MA9\nmodel show that surface marker analysis of colonies derived from iMLL-AF9 LT-HSC and GMP\nsubpopulations showed cells expressing the Mac-1 and Gr-1 diﬀerentiation markers in addition to\nc-Kit in the presence of Dox [39].",

We recently found that passive therapy with\nantileukaemia sera can give positive results only when the highest possible number of\ncytolytic potency units is administered (Reif and Kim, 1969). To prepare highly potent\nantisera, both immunization schedules and the dependence of the specificity of antisera\non the types of leukaemias injected (Mohos and Kidd, 1957) require investigation. In a\nseparate investigation (Kim and Reif, 1971), we have studied immunization schedules.\nIn the present paper, the requirements for specificity of antisera, in terms of the strain of\n1087",

Non-megakaryoblastic AMLs with TCR rearrangements typically co-express \nphenotypic markers of T-lymphoblastic differentiation, such as CD7, CD2 and CD4 \n(Schmidt et al, 1992). We postulate that this is the subset of AMLs that also harbour \nmutations that are commonly observed in a distinct subset of T-ALL, including WT1, PHF6, \nRUNX1 and BCL11B (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; Della Gatta et \nal, 2012; Ding et al, 2012; Klco et al, 2015; Tosello et al, 2009; Van Vlierberghe et al, 2010; \nVan Vlierberghe et al, 2011b; Zhang et al, 2012). Thus, a similar group of acute leukaemias \nexhibit shared features of myeloid and T cell lymphoid differentiation, and shared genetic \nmutations, which will need to be formally assessed in future studies.",

While studies of endogenous haematopoiesis have \nrevealed limited evidence of a putative normal progenitor whose fate is restricted \nto T-lymphoid and myeloid lineages, the identification of such a progenitor may \nhave been hindered by differences in the lifespan of mature myeloid versus T-\nlymphoid cells. Nevertheless, even if a normal progenitor whose differentiation \nfate is restricted to T-lymphocytes and myeloid cells is lacking, such leukaemias \ncan arise from cells that retain multi-lineage potential, even though their fate is \nnormally restricted to a single lineage by microenvironmental signals. Immature \nintrathymic T cell progenitors at early double-negative stages of differentiation \nrepresent one potential cell of origin for such leukaemias.

However, we note that aberrant expression of CD4 and CD7 is relatively \ncommon in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL), a subtype of AML that is \nmolecularly distinct from AMTL (de Rooij et al, 2017). Therefore, AMKL should be \nexcluded from the definition of AMTL, based on absence of megakaryblastic morphology \nand expression of the platelet markers CD41 or CD61. Thus, our initial proposal for AMTL \nas a diagnostic entity includes all cases currently classified as ETP T-ALL and T/myeloid \nMPALs, together with the subset of AMLs with TCR rearrangements and expression of T-\nlymphoblastic markers.",

A total of twenty patients with acute leukaemias having undergone HSCT were selected and assessed for \nthe analysis of chimerism status. DNA extraction from the whole blood was done by chelex method and short tandem \nrepeats were amplified by using conventional STR- PCR assay. Electrophoresis was carried out and 6% polyacrylamide \ngels  were  used  for  the  resultant  amplified  DNA  products  and  then  followed  by  their  densitometry.  These  patients \nhad undergone HSCT from Pakistan Institute of Medical Science and Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre. \nResults: The peaks in the PAGE densitometry represented the donor chimerism in all post transplant samples of the \npatients. \nConclusion: Our study showed that densitometry of STR PCR PAGE is a useful and cheaper method for demonstration \nof donor chimerism in acute leukaemia patients having undergone HSCT. Hence this method can be a valuable option \nin the monitoring of chimerism status in these patients and therefore helps in preventing graft failure by fast and early \ntreatment strategies for these patients.",
